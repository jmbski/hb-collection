A place of mystery and wonder, these islands are home to pirates, vagrants, and all manner of strange folk – but the forces of the Inquisition have set their sights on these isles you call home, and will stop at nothing to eradicate your people as they seek a powerful pirate artifact buried in the region. Recruit and lead an undead pirate crew from aboard your ghost ship to outwit your enemy, striking from the shadows with both blade and sorcery to save your people.</p>
<p><img height=&quot;53&quot; src=&quot;https://hb.imgix.net/9e0c4edfedbfd0c24539dab448a7056963d45ff2.png?auto=compress,format&amp;s=a8dc2b594aeb4a0e917c7d416627460e&quot; width=&quot;616&quot;></p>

 </video></p>
<p>Take charge of an infamous pirate ship and reunite its cursed crew as you fight back against the Inquisition across the multiple islands that dot the region. With eight undead crew members waiting to be revived, you can choose who to recruit to your cause, and when – there are no wrong choices, but your crew’s composition will determine how you traverse the islands, your unique experience through the narrative campaign, and what abilities you have at your disposal at any given time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each of your eight shipmates is an individual armed with their own unique supernatural powers and mildly unhinged personalities – use these to your advantage in clever and creative ways to overcome obstacles and enemies. Will you bring Gaëlle and her magical cannon to launch friends over walls and chasms, or will you rely on Mr. Mercury’s ability to bypass obstacles from below? Or perhaps von Presswald can simply possess an enemy guard, use him to unlock the gates, and stand idly by as the rest of your motley crew walks in? Use these and other abilities individually and in tandem, timing their executions to orchestrate intricate maneuvers and attacks against overwhelming odds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mix and match your crew's abilities to find your preferred playstyle among the countless synergies that you can deploy against the Inquisition. Each person’s skills are tailored to specific archetypes built around manipulating movement, operating behind enemy lines, hiding the bodies of dispatched enemies, or being particularly capable killers. Missions will limit how many crew members you can take with you, so choose your comrades wisely based on their abilities and limitations.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The forces of the Inquisition are numerous and well-armed, easily able to overwhelm your crew in a fair fight – make use of cover, darkness, and magic to neutralize your opponents without being seen as you traverse the many islands to accomplish your objectives.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Missions span across entire islands in the Lost Caribbean, and not only can you choose the order in which you tackle those missions, but you’ll also have the choice of where to arrive ashore and depart once the deed is done. Will you prioritize safety, targeting less patrolled areas that may be more distant from your objectives? Or will you seek to make haste, arriving at and leaving from more heavily guarded parts of the island to be closer to your objective from start to finish?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The various types of enemies have different strengths and weaknesses, each warranting varied strategies – what may easily distract or defeat one foe may have no effect on another adversary. From the lowly footman to the snipers hiding on high all the way to the magically linked pairs of enemies who must be killed in tandem, your foe will always seek new ways to thwart you, pushing you towards inventive new solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep an eye on your enemies’ movements and lines of sight as you navigate the light and shadow, and make sure no-one is watching when you make that killing blow. Your crew’s abilities can complement your surroundings, as well as open up new strategies not otherwise available. Nowhere to hide? Suledie’s magic can create cover anywhere, allowing you to get even closer for the kill, or sneak past any watchful eyes undetected. Particularly attentive guards watching a path from above? Gaëlle’s cannon can launch friends (and foes) to land onto them, knocking them out at the same time.</p>

<p>Your ship will be your home between missions – a place where you can engage in your crew mates’ personal stories and side-quests, and perhaps more importantly, where you can make your plans to stay a step ahead of the Inquisition.</p>
<p><i>Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew</i> takes a non-linear approach to storytelling – you can unlock new crew members in whatever order you please, and more islands get revealed as you make progress, each harboring multiple missions featuring different rewards beyond simple victory over your enemy.</p>
<p>There is no one designated path forward – missions always have multiple approaches available based on the team you’ve brought with you, but with such freedom of choice, there are many factors to consider. Will you temporarily avoid a more challenging mission to chase after a simpler one and gain more experience first? This may allow you to upgrade your crew’s abilities to more powerful versions that open up new paths. Or perhaps an entirely different, not-yet-unlocked crew member would be useful instead?</p>
<p>The Inquisition must be stopped at all costs – assemble your crew, learn their powers, and take the fight to the enemy, one island at a time. The fate of your world, and the lives of your comrades, is at stake.</p>`)">Details</button>

Circumstances force you to fight. Like all the time. Always outnumbered. Build your walls, raise your armies, and experience warfare on an entirely new scale. Over 25 THOUSAND enemies assault your castle walls. You're going to master engineering, economy and even magic If you hope to survive. <strong> <br><br>The Law Of War </strong> <br><video autoplay=&quot;autoplay&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; muted=&quot;muted&quot; preload=&quot;auto&quot;>

</video> <br>Your King is a mighty and powerful leader. Also, he is an egocentric pig. Adores to drink and in general he's enjoying his life. But after the treasury had emptied and even raising taxes had not helped, it became clear that he could not continue his leisurely lifestyle. Which is a problem. Mostly yours. Because peasants, who are not fond of raised taxes and hunger, are rioting in your feud. King demands you put down the rebellion and go to the distant land to get some gold. (Rumors are there is one where there are tons of it) Will you do as your sovereign bids and set sail to replenish the palace coffers? Will you join the violent leader of rebels to bring the tyrant to justice? Will you help poor natives of Uncharted Continent? Or will you cast aside human nature and ambition and lead armies of Undead? Questions, questions, questions. The one thing you can be sure of is that no matter what faction you support there will be blood anyway. And legions of archers, swordsmen, siege weapons, knights, and more will be staying by your side for you to achieve your goal. <strong> <br><br>The Physical Laws </strong> <br><video autoplay=&quot;autoplay&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; muted=&quot;muted&quot; preload=&quot;auto&quot;>

</video> <br>While admittedly tongue-in-cheek, the laws of physics are still deadly serious in <i>Diplomacy Is Not An Option</i>. Every arrow, catapult stone and enemy launched skywards is physically modeled, making for a tactile and coherent battlefield. Just make sure your troops have towers to shoot from and clear lines of sight, or you might find your best-laid plans embarrassingly blunted by your own fortifications. Consider your gates, your lines of advancement and retreat. Create kill-zones and fall-back positions. You will need to take an active role in combat to get the best from your men. <strong> <br><br>The Laws of a Functional Society </strong> <br><video autoplay=&quot;autoplay&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; muted=&quot;muted&quot; preload=&quot;auto&quot;>

</video> <br>Even under siege, never forget your castle was built on the backs of the peasantry. Defend your people, and they’ll serve you well. Engage in agriculture and farming, or food can become scarce, and your soldiers can starve on the battlefield. Build houses, bury fallen soldiers and peasants to prevent plague, and treat the infected when death comes knocking. If you do not care for your people you may soon find yourself overrun with the most unpleasant troubles. Like empty stockpiles, unrepaired walls and running dry barracks… or be overrun literally with swarms of zombies. And no lord wishes to see zombie apocalypse in the backyard of his castle, right? <strong> <br><br>Economic Laws </strong> <br><video autoplay=&quot;autoplay&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; muted=&quot;muted&quot; preload=&quot;auto&quot;>

</video> <br>A functional army requires a functional economy to support and feed it. Food, Wood, Stone, Iron, and Gold are the foundations of your city’s economy, and you will need to watch your supplies carefully if you are to meet the advancing foe in a timely manner. Gather resources, choose your storage locations, plan your expansions and upgrades with care. The enemy will not cede their lands willingly, and unprotected civilian expansions will have consequences of falling prey to the hostile incursion. Trade, via the impressive merchant dirigible, bringing emergency supplies of food to feed the men, or stone to rebuild the walls. Can you strike the balance between greedy expansion and security? <strong> <br><br>Magic rules! </strong> <br><video autoplay=&quot;autoplay&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; muted=&quot;muted&quot; preload=&quot;auto&quot;>

</video> <br>If life gives you lemons, make lemonade. If you’ve inherited a cursed kingdom, why not master the dark arts? Sturdy castle walls will protect you from most ordinary threats, but in <i>Diplomacy Is Not An Option</i> you're also be battling undeads. So why give them a monopoly on magic? There is a dark history of tainted power that stirs zombies and traps wayward souls. On the lighter side: it can also be used to call down really very big fireballs onto your enemies. So enjoy that too. Build magical monuments, harvest soul crystals and give a try to a maniacal laugh as searing magical beams tear through your foes and summoned ghosts to chase down the stragglers. <strong> <br><br>Beyond the rules </strong> <br><video autoplay=&quot;autoplay&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; muted=&quot;muted&quot; preload=&quot;auto&quot;>

</video> <br>The game has been designed with freedom as a core concept. Go beyond the campaign and crush your foes as you see fit in Endless Mode, Sandbox Mode or Challenge Mode. Develop your own personal strategies on procedurally generated maps. Go heavy on walls early, build large armies of cannon-fodder, or pursue the macro game of greedy growth and costly investments. Play battles in real-time or use pause constantly to keep everything in your hands. Will you be able to stand on a par with the most acclaimed generals in the world, like Joan of Arc and Genghis Khan? Finding which style grants you the most success is up to you. <strong> <br><br>The fundamental Laws of life </strong> <br>As in real life, stupidity and greed lie behind most problems, but here it is far too late to talk it through. You have no recourse to resolve this peacefully. At this stage: <i>Diplomacy Is Not an Option</i>!`)">Details</button>

She calls them Sisters. They call her the ALLMOTHER.

Unlike the ALLMOTHER, the sisters are not immune. They must wear masks 24/7 to avoid breathing the diseased air even in the Orchard - an underground bunker where they live in constant fear of an Occupant attack.

 </li>
 <li>
  2 Challenges for every map, which offer a unique spin and a change of pace.
 </li>
</ul>
<br>
The game is all about finding builds that you feel are powerful and fun, while also never making the game too easy to play that it becomes boring. The first Map allows for you to enjoy the game and experiment with various stats while taking on unique challenges, whereas the second Map is significantly more difficult and will preset a serious challenge to anyone that wants to test their mettle against more serious opponents, events, and Boss enemies.

It’ll take more than a fresh set of tires to keep you alive, on and off the road. Your faithful wagon can be upgraded and reinforced to protect you, but the car is going to take a beating. Keep your gas tank filled and your panels intact to withstand the radiation permeating the Zone. You’ll be pushed to your limit - making repairs on the fly, scavenging materials wherever you can, and adapting your rolling fortress to tackle the many life-threatening dangers that lurk in the shadows. <br><br><strong> INVESTIGATE THE ZONE </strong> <br><img height=&quot;135&quot; src=&quot;https://hb.imgix.net/4f297d2c8b997bedb96576c822baf0ee8da83ab2.png?auto=compress,format&amp;s=bb3da258f5ef023e5ceaa159b49fff78&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;> <br>The experimental leftovers of the secretive ARDA organization remain scattered across the Zone, and finding answers won’t be easy. Everywhere you look you’ll find anomalies, surreal forces of a twisted nature that make your journey more difficult... or more interesting. Silhouettes in the dark, rolling piles of scrap metal, and towering pillars of earth - each trip is packed with otherworldly hazards. As terrifying as those may be, nothing compares to the overwhelming power of a Zone Storm. Stomp on the gas and outrun it if you can - these rolling maelstroms rend the landscape and obliterate anything that sticks around too long. Don’t let that be you. <br><br><strong> REPEAT </strong> <br><img height=&quot;135&quot; src=&quot;https://hb.imgix.net/91fed76e389b81bf58a45f9e5937a3d281116c89.png?auto=compress,format&amp;s=96c02d82ac09b6d0d6282211f2f7b37b&quot; width=&quot;599&quot;> <br>Check the map, pack some gear for the trip, and hit the road. Gather resources and collect data as you go, there’s all sorts of useful stuff inside the walls of the Zone. Make it back safely and use the contents of your trunk to improve your car and garage. Every time you venture out, new trials await: bizarre weather, unforgiving landscapes, and experimental remnants.

<strong>
 COLLECT THEM ALL:
</strong>
Each world is full of goodies to find - 40 eggs placed in perilous situations, mushrooms to feed your siblings once they hatch, collectible cards to fill out an Encyclopedia, and more!
<br>
◼
<strong>
 ACQUIRE NEW ABILITIES:
</strong>
Collecting eggs allows the Sage to grant Fynn new body parts, which give him new abilities! Use your tail, wings, and more to reach areas you couldn’t before and move super fast!
<br>
◼
<strong>
 NON-VIOLENT APPROACH:
</strong>
Fynn is a peaceful little guy, so there’s no combat in the game. Instead, the focus is on exploration, puzzle-solving, and platforming. This, however, does not mean there are no dangers lurking in the <i>Cavern of Dreams</i>, so best be careful.
<br>
◼
<strong>
 MEET A WHIMSICAL CAST OF CHARACTERS:
</strong>
Each world is populated with strange characters who need your help. You may chat up a tree, assist a mermaid, or free a sentient soup dumpling!
<br>

<strong>
 THE NOSTALGIC OST:
</strong>
Fully immerse yourself in <i>Cavern of Dreams</i> through a nostalgic and mysterious soundtrack, with each world having multiple versions of its theme based on where you are.

In a futuristic world populated by sentient robots, its inhabitants are once more threatened by an old foe, the Virus Army. Defeated decades ago, it has re-emerged from the shadows with a unique goal, complete world domination. Severely weakened Guardian Corps are left with no other choice but to call upon a hero of the previous war: the lone operative, Kai, who harnesses the powers of the mysterious <i>Gravity Circuit</i>.

Tactical, beautiful, and wholly unique, the GOTY-winning sci-fi RTS returns with <i>Homeworld 3</i>. Assume control and battle through fleet combat in dazzling, fully 3D space while the award-winning story unfolds on a galactic scale.
<br>
<br>
<img height=&quot;90&quot; src=&quot;https://hb.imgix.net/419f3d7d1063fad7877595725de5a9d4b03f4994.png?auto=compress,format&s=851f9e3a8766787d027a3a40950fc739&quot; width=&quot;615&quot;>
<br>
<br>
Strategic freedom is yours. Hulking space derelicts called megaliths bring 3D terrain into the classic Homeworld battlespace. Use the crumbling remains of an ancient civilization to funnel foes into a brilliant ambush or hide your fleet from powerful enemies. Fortresses teem with menacing turrets and invite your strike craft into dangerous trench runs deep behind enemy lines. But not everything is in your control. Dangerous space phenomena like particle storms and asteroid fields will test even senior commanders.

<br>
<br>
Attack head-on, with a clever flank, or even from above and below your foes. <i>Homeworld 3</i>’s fully simulated ballistics make line of sight and cover critical strategic considerations. Your fleet persists from mission to mission. Scars on your ships linger. Strike craft pilots and capital ship captains pass along critical information through battlefield chatter.

Homeworld’s timeless art style evolves with modern technology, offering an incredible sense of scale, destruction, and wonder. Strike craft fly in formation between hulking Battlecruisers against a backdrop of stars and nebulae. Iconic ships cast silhouettes over the remains of ancient civilizations. Explosions ripple and erupt across hulls as one fleet stakes its victory over another.

Homeworld’s game-of-the-year winning story continues. Since the end of Homeworld 2, the galaxy enjoyed an age of abundance thanks to the Hyperspace Gate Network. Cycles of plenty and war have come and gone. Now the gates themselves are catastrophically failing and Karan, who has passed into myth and religious idolatry, is the key to the mystery threatening a galaxy’s future.

Thanks to the praying cards in your hand, you will be able to influence the outcome of the fights, but you'll have to do it swiftly: since all of the action is happening in real time the enemies will attack you as soon as they can, whether you played your cards or not. No need to rush into the melee though, for the boosts you give to your character carry on between the fights, so take your time to wisely select the cards you will take with you on your journey.

 Dynamic real time combat with increasing intensity:

Quickly use your cards to give your character a chance to survive not only the current fight, but also the ones to come. Everything happens in real time so you need to help your avatar by using your cards before he gets crushed by the relentless attacks of the spirit.

<strong>
 Manage your character appropriately:
</strong>
Act fast but not too hastily, the intensity of the fights will keep increasing so you need to optimize your character's boosts properly if you want to stand a chance. Since stats boosts you give your character persist between encounters, you may want to think about what would be the most useful things to increase from the start.

<strong>
 Build your deck:
</strong>
According to your play-style and the dangers to come, you may choose different kinds of cards to take with you on your journey. You'll have to make a choice, and this choice will determine what options will be available to you when the time to fight comes.

Your life will depend on how well you manage and grow your settlement. Fortunately, you're not alone in this dark world — your peasants will help you gather resources, craft items, and build defenses as you lead them through danger and privation. But remember, every choice you make has consequences and can lead your village to prosperity or a senseless death from the plague.</span></p>
<p><b>Build your settlement</b></p>
<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>Start from a clean slate and build a brand-new civilization. Assign each peasant a specific role and order them to build, craft, or gather the resources you need to survive the hardships you will face. With dozens of upgradable buildings and hundreds of items to craft and customize, including farms and animals, you're free to shape your settlement as you see fit. But don't let your growing dynasty blind you — hostile forces lurk nearby, ready to spill your blood.</span></p>
<p><b>Recruit allies</b></p>
<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>The only way to break through the endless darkness of Nested Lands is to gather the other survivors who share your plight, but have yet to fully give up hope. Save and recruit peasants during your journey across the world. But keep in mind that they will need your protection.</span></p>
<p><b>Make your name</b></p>
<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>Start from nothing. Rise from the bottom, overcome monumental challenges, and make your fame echo across the Nested Lands. But be careful - all your decisions will be carefully watched and evaluated. Will your name be praised by all, or will its very sound instill fear into the common folk who dwell in this open world? The choice is yours.</span></p>
<p><b>Survive in a post-plague world</b></p>
<p><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>The disfigured nature of the world makes survival even more challenging. Before facing other threats, you need to secure the basics — a lack of medicine can wipe your village out faster than any blade. Craft, improve your skills, and endure the harsh reality of Nested Lands. Brutal weather and the coming winter may be your greatest foes, but random encounters won't offer any respite.</span></p>
<p><b>Play alone or with friends</b></p>

        <button onclick="showDescription(`You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in <i>Against the Storm</i> you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs.
<br>
<br>
The wilderness holds many hidden dangers, and never-ending storms will batter your population into submission. If your settlements should fall, then the expedition may end – but not the game. <i>Against the Storm</i> is a roguelite city builder, meaning you will carry forward the resources, upgrades, and experience of your past expeditions each time you set off for a new journey into the wild.

Foxes, beavers, and lizards stand alongside humans and harpies in the struggle to survive.

Will you manufacture raincoats, brew ale, and bake pies to boost morale in the face of the oppressive hostility of the forest, or will you prioritize the needs of one species over another to operate more swiftly for the Scorched Queen?

With hundreds of gameplay modifiers and 6 distinct biomes, every city location presents unique challenges for even the most resourceful Viceroy. Adjust your strategy to changing weather conditions and experiment with rosters of building blueprints and perks that can help your society thrive or bring it to ruin. Will you take on and complete additional objectives and delve deeper into the dangerous forest for potential boons, or will you approach with caution to ensure you operate within your capabilities? All the while, you never know what wares the Trader will bring next year, and the forest holds treasures and resources, but also ancient threats.

Each time you dive into the depths, you choose a second hero to accompany you. As a companion, each hero brings eight unique powers. With dozens of possible duos you can develop your own playstyle or try improbable duos.
<br>
Do you need an expert against boss fights or a proto-blacksmith that enhances your card upgrades?

Position on the battlefield has never been more important! Line up enemies for super attacks, move to a different zone to avoid being hit, or position enemies to knock into each other.

Cards don’t just get better. Each card upgrade comes with a difficult strategic choice between two upgrades. Choose wisely, depending on your deck and playstyle.
<br>
<br>
A powerful bonus but only for the round? Or the same bonus but for the whole fight? Two different paths...

<i>Old World</i> is a historical strategy game where you lead your empire through multiple generations, building a grand legacy to last beyond your own years. This is an era of great leaders, from the revered to the feared. Which will you be?
<br>
<br>
<img height=&quot;70&quot; src=&quot;https://hb.imgix.net/880f388848ba526edd6ca73de5d61f115411707c.png?auto=compress,format&s=8e1c706f26ed7ccf40b8fe9e4e207dc0&quot; width=&quot;616&quot;>
<br>
Marry for politics, raise your heirs, and manage your relationship with the families of your kingdom. In the fast and furious world of kings and queens, family matters.
<br>
<br>
<ul>
 <li>
  Each of the 7 kingdoms has four noble families that provide various benefits when put in charge of your cities.
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>
  Manage family ties through events, actions, and marriages to keep them happy and reap additional benefits. Upset them, or make them too powerful, and you risk their ire.
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>
  Maintain a strong family unit, or distract yourself with more illicit adventures.
 </li>
</ul>
<br>

<br>
The world is full of great characters with distinct personalities, strengths, and weaknesses. Use them to forge your kingdom, defend your borders, and build ties with other leaders.
<br>
<br>
<ul>
 <li>
  Seek out and recruit famed warriors, philosophers, builders, and more. Have them tutor your children, lead your armies, and further your reign.
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>
  Different personality archetypes allow your court members to perform different tasks in similar roles. Find the right combinations to take full advantage of governors, diplomats, spymasters, and even your spouse.
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>
  Characters develop new personalities and traits over time, growing old, gaining experience, and finally falling ill and passing away, leaving room for the next generation.
 </li>
</ul>

Why do things the way they've always been done? <i>Old World</i> brings a new take to key elements of the 4X strategy genre:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
 <li>
  Go beyond the traditional resources. Buildings are made of wood and stone, not &quot;industry.&quot; Population doesn't grow off &quot;food&quot; alone.
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>
  Orders are a resource shared across your realm. Instead of moving every unit once per turn, each unit can be moved multiple times until fatigued or Orders are depleted.
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>
  Technological advancement is not predetermined. Randomization helps keep technology trees feeling fresh with each new playthrough.
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>
  Quality of life improvements, such as the ability to undo mistaken commands and nested tooltips, ensure you're always making informed decisions.
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>
  Play with friends in countless multiplayer modes — from hotseat, to asynchronous, to cloud play.
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>
  Experience a Grammy-nominated soundtrack blending Arabic music with contemporary influences.
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>
  Mods further open up infinite options for new worlds, empires, and dynasties — inspired by our real world, and by works of fiction as well.
 </li>

Hit the road with &quot;<i>Monster Prom 3: Monster Roadtrip</i>&quot;, a vibrant sequel that twists the Monster Prom formula in an exciting new way. At its core, this is a very similar game: a multiplayer narrative adventure full of colorful characters and fresh funny dialogues. But this time the goal isn't getting a date, but surviving a road trip (although you still can score a date if you play wisely).
<br>
<br>
You and up to 3 friends will face all kinds of wacky conflicts, choosing from options in order to manage your road trip resources. If a resource hits zero... you can kiss your trip goodbye!
<br>
But fulfill the right requirements and you may reach one of the dreamy destinations that will put an epic end to this experience.

What can you expect from this monstrous road trip?

<br>
- A co-op narrative adventure with survival mechanics
<br>
- You can play with friends both through local and online multiplayer!
<br>
- YES! There's still the option of dating. This time flirting is not the core of the game, but you can still get a date with Polly, Scott, or one of the 10+ available hitchhikers by the end of the game!
<br>
- TONS of beautiful art like you have never seen before in these series (seriously, there's A LOT of art packed in here)
<br>
- Even if it's a co-op game, there's a social competitive aspect that will provide a thrill for the game. Choosing how much to seek your own benefit and how much to focus on the group goal!
<br>
- Several brand new characters, and some beloved characters from previous games will be making a comeback!
<br>
- Radio stations to choose from, with different music genres to build the perfect mood!

 <i>Inkulinati</i>
</strong>
is a turn-based strategy game inspired by medieval manuscripts. Draw your army of Beasts, and spill the ink of your enemy, defeat medieval superstars and collect perks to unleash hidden powers. Being a master of the quill isn’t easy, so make sure you’re focused and plan every move wisely. Embark on your journey and become the greatest <i>Inkulinati</i> of all time!
<br>
<br>

<br>
Don’t let the looks fool you. <i>Inkulinati</i> is a game of nuance and brain-sizzling challenge that will test even the most hardened strategists. And as every hardened armchair general knows, it all starts with your units, which we call Beasts. There are multiple deadly (and bizarre)
<strong>
 Beasts
</strong>
to unlock. They all have their special individual skills, as well as class-specific abilities causing different effects. And when these Beasts work in unison, a symphony of destruction, death, until the literal apocalypse will endure.
<br>

</video>
<br>
<br>
It’s not just your Beasts that can cause havoc and damage. There are special, battle tide-turning actions performed by the
<strong>
 <i>Inkulinati</i> Masters
</strong>
themselves - such as yourself! Use your unique Hand Actions to smash your opponent's units, draw obstacles to create barriers, relocate your units with a move of your finger, or explode your troops to create pure, pure chaos. Just remember - your opponent can do it too. And to keep it more interesting, each <i>Inkulinati</i> Master can have their own set of Talents too that can help win the battle.
<br>

</video>
<br>
<br>
But wait, there’s more. You will need to adapt your tactics to every battle. Each Battlefield is its own domain, with its own particular dangers that you should watch out for, and opportunities that you can use. Look out for objects that are scattered all over the
<strong>
 Battlefields
</strong>
, such as exploding Pots of Beans, travelling Hell’s Maws, Clouds of Blessings, and use them to your advantage.
<br>
<br>
And just when you think you have a handle on the battle, an
<strong>
 Apocalyptic event
</strong>
can come in and flip all of your plans upside down. We’re talking fires, plagues, and the Memento Mori itself. However, when all hope is lost and you’re on the ropes, an Apocalypse might be just what you need to turn the tide in your favour.

700 years in the making, finally these bizarre art pieces can come alive in a video game and show that medieval people also had their “memes” and that they laughed from the same silly things that we do today. You’ll see sword-wielding rabbits, dogs with spears, trumpets lodged in bottoms, human-eating snails, and more. Much, much more…

Together, you’ll tackle a series of increasingly challenging levels that adapt to the size of your team, the characters you play and the perks you pick together. No two runs are quite the same when the players and the game itself are changing!

To help ghosts cross over to the other side, you must first understand them.
<br>
<br>
<i>Remnant Records</i> is a horror investigation game for 1 to 4 players, in which you are the newest recruit of an agency that deals with these paranormal matters. Choose the role that fits your favourite game style, and face complex ghosts, each with unique behaviors and reactions. Your job will be to exorcise and free them with the help of your team.
<br>
<br>
To exorcise a spirit, you first have to understand it. Search the place and find the clues left behind: diaries, newspaper cuts, unusual objects. Understand the person they was before their death, and gather as many items that are closely related to them as you can. Once you're ready, all you've got left to do is start the exorcism, pray you've understood everything correctly... and survive until the ghost is freed from this world.

 <br>
 Produce Everything you Consume
</strong>
<br>
Out on the edges of human space, you can't build a city by spending credits. Instead, you'll have to put your first astronauts to mining work and get some raw materials. Once you have some iron, carbon, sand, and sulfur, it's time to set up your first steel mill and concrete factory to start laying down some infrastructure. Even necessities like food and oxygen require a steady production chain that must not be broken!
<br>
<br>

</video>
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Transport Infrastructure
</strong>
<br>
<i>InfraSpace</i> simulates every. single. car. Each resource you ever produce needs to be transported to a factory for processing and each product needs to go to a habitat for consumption. Your road network can handle a lot, but without your oversight it will grind to a halt and drown in traffic eventually. Build highways, roundabouts, and multi lane roads to ensure the production heart of the city keeps beating.
<br>
<br>

</video>
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Trains, Pipes, and Cargo Lifts
</strong>
<br>
Your road network might be versatile, but it's not the right choice for every kind of resource - or the most fun one. Build rails and train stations to haul massive amounts of goods. Build underground pipes to pump liquids and gases all over the city. Build cargo lifts to reach the highest mountain tops and traverse even the most rugged terrain.
<br>

</video>
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Population Growth
</strong>
<br>
Your first colonists will be astronauts, the best and the bravest humanity has to offer. Give them food and shelter and they'll keep your outpost running no matter what. As your settlement grows, you need to cover the increasing workload by employing scientists and engineers, which require a few more creature comforts. Any city of sufficient size will sooner or later be home to more and more families as well, so make sure your schools can handle it and you are able to deliver the latest VR-edutainment products as well.

 <br>
 Terraform the Planet
</strong>
<br>
Living on a desert planet can be harsh - but you have your eyes set on the dream: Terraform the planet, make the desert green and the atmosphere breathable. It's a huge undertaking, requiring a colossal amount of resources. Don't despair, because by the time you're starting this project, you have all the technology, infrastructure, and manpower necessary to make this dream a reality!

</video>
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 You don't have to play hard
</strong>
<br>
Traffic management can be fickle and survival can be tough. You can adjust the difficulties of both to make your city management experience as easy - or as hard - as you want it to be.

 AN UNFORGIVING WORLD
</strong>
<br>
<i>Stranded: Alien Dawn</i> pushes you and your survivors to the brink. Limited resources, unpredictable weather, illness and hostile alien creatures make it hard to establish a foothold on an unforgiving world.

<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 AN UNPREDICTABLE JOURNEY
</strong>
<br>
In <i>Stranded: Alien Dawn</i>, every playthrough is unique. Experience a journey driven by random story events, alien wildlife threats and adverse weather. There will be setbacks; devise your own innovative solutions to problems and manage multiple crises at the same time. However, actions have consequences and as you strive to plan ahead, you must make difficult choices to shape the story of your survivors, balancing short and long-term outcomes with risk and reward.
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>

 <br>
 MODULAR BASE-BUILDING
</strong>
<br>
Design and build your base on an alien world and transform it from simple shelter to high-tech outpost. Protect it with perimeter defences, decorate it with furnishings, introduce automated devices such as defensive turrets, and discover new technology to create your own functioning space pad.

 ABOUT THIS GAME
</strong>
<br>
Fly solo or with up to three other loyal crewmates as you boldly go where no-one has gone (and survived to talk about it) before. Obtain and upgrade new weapons and systems for your ship as you venture deep into a procedurally generated universe filled with increasingly grumpy and murder-y enemies. Map your unique path through the stars, but remember that the stakes are super high – one wrong move and it’s game over.
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Up to 4 Players With Local Or Online Co-Op
</strong>
<br>
Space is big and cold, yet still somehow full of things trying to shoot you. You’re free to embark on a trek through the stars on your own, but you can also unite with up to three fellow officers for either local or online co-op!
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Every Game Is Unique
</strong>
<br>
With randomized maps, items, enemies and encounters, no two games are ever alike. Prove you’re a space commander of exceptional calibre by adapting your strategies to survive every unpredictable threat, while making best use of your awesome arsenal of weapons and upgrades!
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Easy To Understand, Tough To Master
</strong>
<br>
She can’t take much more, captain! You’ll be master of your ship in no time, but only the canniest captain can tame the entire galaxy. With gameplay that players themselves have shaped through alpha and beta releases, <i>This Means Warp</i> is a thrilling yet cruel mistress. Remember – in space, no-one can hear you cry like a little baby.

The population of the harsh desert planet Kwalasha needs our help. Their peaceful lives, working in the mining industry, have been disturbed by a threat that they cannot face alone: the Arachnids. Under Colonel Hawthorne’s command, the Mobile Infantry will take back control of the planet and smash everything that has more than two legs. Enlist in this exciting military campaign, meet inspiring characters, visit amazing locations and do your part in the heroic war against the Bug!

The Arachnids may have virtually limitless numbers, but they lack the thorough tactical training that the Mobile Infantry enjoys. Position your units in advantageous choke points or on higher elevations. Be wary, however, that battle mechanics such as True Line of Sight and True Line of Fire may limit your field of fire and allow the treacherous Bugs to lay in ambush.

Optimize your army by choosing from a wide range of specialized unit types, each with its own strengths, weaknesses and set of unlockable elite abilities. Rifle Troopers can use their shotgun ability to hold back large numbers of Arachnids, M11 Marauders bipeds can unleash a withering mortar barrage and the Fleet Liaison can call down dropships with reinforcements or direct an airstrike to wipe out whole swaths of enemies.

The Bug infestation is rooted in elaborate underground hives. These present a unique challenge that demands a delicate balance between aggression and defense. Beware of the numerous tunnel openings, from which hordes of Arachnids can emerge.

<i>A Guidebook of Babel</i> is a story-adventure game based on the butterfly effect. It was released in 2022 during the Nintendo Indie World showcase!
<br>
<br>
You will go on a strange rebirth adventure on Babel. The crew would use Memory Extractor to erase your memories before launching you into the afterlife with the cloud cannon. Passengers frequently moan that it's too late to say farewell to the past, but the crew's prime focus is gathering memories as fuel!
<br>
If you enjoy absorbing stories and mind-boggling puzzles, you've come to the right spot! Across four chapters, you'll need to go back in time and subtly rewrite history, trigger the butterfly effect, solve the puzzles hidden in it, and even change the future of Babel!

You need to help the trapped characters overcome difficulties: escape from the Interrogation Room, collect Stonehearth Crab Egg, and find mysterious signal sources... Don't expect to succeed with brute force!
<br>
Fortunately, you can travel back in time and discover what put them into trouble. Once you've located the crucial event, you can rewrite it with the pen in your hand. This move will immediately trigger a butterfly effect, change the plot's path, and reverse the current situation!

 Having inherited their Aunt Kate’s house, Riley Park starts exploring what the reclusive woman left behind. In the attic, Riley is surprised to find a stack of VHS tapes next to an old TV set. The tapes seem to be episodes of an early 2000’s era children’s cartoon they have never seen before. Intrigued, Riley pops the first tape into the VCR.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 Not the highest budget production from the looks of it. It appears to have been made locally and features a little girl named Amanda and her loyal yet shy best friend, Wooly the Sheep. While the episode appears charming and simple on the surface, an uneasiness starts to settle in as Riley realizes that Amanda and Wooly seem to be communicating directly through the television set. A gnawing feeling in the back of their mind presses them to stop, but Riley is compelled to continue watching the tapes. It’s almost as if Amanda needs something, and Riley becomes fascinated with finding out what that something may be.

When inmates begin to transform into monstrous creatures, the prison is thrown into chaos. To survive, Jacob must battle his way to safety to escape Black Iron Prison, while uncovering the dark and disturbing secrets buried beneath the surface of Callisto. Using a unique blend of shooting and close-quarters combat, Jacob will need to adapt his tactics to combat the rapidly evolving creatures while scavenging to unlock new weapons, gear, and abilities to outrun the growing threat and escape the horrors of Jupiter's Dead Moon.

The Callisto Protocol challenges players to master a thrilling blend of hand-to-hand and ranged combat, including a unique gravity weapon once used by Black Iron guards to control the prison population. Players will be forced to get up close and personal with their grotesque opponents, hacking off limbs, blasting off legs, and getting creative with whatever is at their disposal to survive each life-or-death encounter.
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>

 <br>
 EXPERIENCE THE ISOLATION OF JUPITER'S DEAD MOON

<br>
Antiquarian Thomasina Bateman is writing a book on the barrows of England, documenting the treasures she finds buried within. When an intriguing letter summons her to the small village of Bewlay, tucked away in the remote countryside, she sets off by train with her assistant a day behind.
<br>
<br>
Upon her arrival, however, the mysterious man who summoned her is nowhere to be found. Her assistant never arrives. A stubborn landowner refuses access to the barrow, and the locals are wary of this woman who is traveling alone and (gasp!) wears trousers.
<br>
<br>
<strong>
 The excavation of Hob’s Barrow is off to a rocky start. And then Thomasina starts having strange dreams…

UNLEASH YOUR DARKNESS
<br>
<br>
Experience the thrill of taking on hordes of fearsome yokai in a battle to the death in this brutal masocore Action RPG. Create your own original protagonist and embark on an adventure that will take you through devastated locales across Japan during the Sengoku period.
<br>
<br>
Much like the previous title which garnered much praise from fans and critics alike, Nioh 2 contains an original profound story surrounding military commanders from the Sengoku period. However, Nioh 2 goes above and beyond its predecessor by including the new Yokai Shift ability which allows the protagonist to utilize new powerful forms to defeat even the most formidable yokai in battle. New to Nioh 2, your enemies can now create a Dark Realm which raises the stakes of battle and creates new challenges for your protagonist to overcome. We hope you enjoy conquering fearsome monsters as you unleash your darkness in the world of Nioh 2.

</video> <br>One of 2022’s most acclaimed indies, the Game Awards-nominated <i>Citizen Sleeper</i> is a Tabletop-inspired narrative RPG set on Erlin’s Eye, a ruined space station that is home to thousands of people trying to survive on the edges of an interstellar capitalist society. <br><br>You are a sleeper, a digitised human consciousness in an artificial body, owned by a corporation that wants you back. Thrust amongst the unfamiliar and colourful inhabitants of the Eye, you need to build friendships, earn your keep, and navigate the factions of this strange metropolis, if you hope to survive to see the next cycle. <br><br><video autoplay=&quot;autoplay&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; muted=&quot;muted&quot; preload=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 248px;&quot;>

 <strong>
  Welcome to Snowtopia, a world of endless winter fun.
 </strong>
</u>
<br>
<br>
Build the ideal ski resort to keep your skiers smiling all the way down the mountain. Get to know every cliff and crevice as you plan pistes, place lifts and build essential facilities. Take on the challenge to create a resort where life is always good!
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Plan your pistes
</strong>
<br>
<br>
Place pistes on the mountainside in just a few clicks with the easy-to-use creation tool. Read the terrain, and choose the best spot to lay down trails for every skier ability.
<br>
<br>

</video>
<br>
11 different types of ski lift give you plenty of choice for scaling the heights. 12-person gondola lifts are fast, but tricky to build on the steep mountain slopes. A two-person chairlift might be a better choice, but watch out for queues at the bottom!
<br>
<br>
Luckily, ever-advancing ski lift technology means there are always new options to try. The latest models can make even the highest peaks accessible in no time.
<br>
<br>
Plan, build and improve until you’ve created your dream ski area.
<br>

<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Welcome skiers of every kind
</strong>
<br>
<br>
You might have thought perfect pistes were enough to keep skiers happy, but it’s not so simple. With 12 different skier profiles in the game, some are more interested in a good raclette, while others come to commune with nature. And then there are the hardcore ski fanatics, who won’t settle for anything less than the longest run the mountain has to offer.
<br>
<br>
There’s no money in Snowtopia. Make your skiers happy enough and they might  join the team of volunteers running the resort. Divide your workforce between the lift operators, maintenance crew, service facilities, and resort improvement team.
<br>
<br>
Growing the reputation of your resort leads to more skiers on the slopes. But beware - more skiers means more accidents! Make sure you have enough snow groomers and ski patrols to keep the slopes safe at all times.
<br>
<br>
Remember, no one likes a broken chairlift, but everyone loves sunbathing on the terrace!
<br>

<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Sit back and chill on the mountain
</strong>
<br>
<br>
Once your resort is built and your skiers are happy, you deserve a little break. So find yourself a perfect little corner on the mountain to drink it all in, maybe near a pretty forest piste next to a ski lift perched on a picturesque clifftop.
<br>
<br>
You’re in the mountains. Enjoy the frosty kiss of the cold air on your face and kick back to some cool tunes.
<br>
<br>
Welcome to Snowtopia, the game where it’s good to just chill.

is an atmospheric first-person horror adventure game set in a nightmarish universe of odd forms and somber tapestry.

It is designed around the idea of &quot;being thrown into the world&quot;. Isolated and lost inside this dream-like world, you will explore different interconnected regions in a non-linear fashion. The unsettling environment is a character itself.
<br>
<br>
Every location contains its own theme (story), puzzles and characters that are integral in creating a cohesive world. Throughout the game you will open up new areas, acquire different skill sets, weapons, various items and try to comprehend the sights presented to you.

<strong>
 COHESIVE &quot;LIVED-IN&quot; WORLD
</strong>
<br>
<i>
 <i>Scorn</i>
</i>
takes place in an open-ended world with different interconnected regions. Each region is a maze-like structure with various rooms and paths to discover. All the storytelling happens in-game, with no cut-scenes to distract you from the grisly reality of the living, breathing world you’re in. But keep your eyes open - the game won’t show you any sympathy if you miss something important on your uneasy travels.

<strong>
 FULL BODY AWARENESS
</strong>
<br>
Players will experience better immersion being aware of the character’s body and movement. Interaction with the world is realistic - objects are picked up with your hands (instead of just floating in midair), machines and instruments are operated by grabbing the controls, etc.

<br>
<strong>
 INVENTORY AND AMMO MANAGEMENT
</strong>
<br>
Your loadout is defined and limited. This plays a big role in keeping the player in an even greater state of awareness throughout the whole game. Players will have to think about when to fight and when to take cover and how their actions affect the world around them. Different play styles will be needed to advance.

Campus is jam-packed with new creative tools to help you build the university of your dreams. <br><br>For the first time, build in the great outdoors as you develop your own delightfully educational campus environment, housing the top teaching facilities in the land. Whether you prefer building on simple foundations, or placing every tree, you can build the university you want. <br><br>Lay down pathways with new easy-to-use tools. Plant glorious collections of outdoor flora. Place benches, fountains, sculptures, hedgerows – even picket fences.

The academic year begins with a summer break, giving you enough time to get everything looking great before your students move in. <br><br>Build libraries, hire the best staff (from eccentric professors to madcap researchers), kit your campus out with the best courses and watch the academic potential of your students get unlocked! <br><br><strong> Shaping the future </strong> <br><br><video autoplay=&quot;autoplay&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; muted=&quot;muted&quot; preload=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;width: 616px; height: 250px;&quot;>

<strong>
 <i>Hell Pie</i>
</strong>
is an obscene 3D platformer that takes bad taste to the next level! The game sees you grab the horns of Nate, the
<strong>
 ‘Demon of Bad Taste’
</strong>
. He is given the honorable task of gathering the disgusting ingredients for Satan’s infamous birthday pie. To do so, Nate must venture out into the overworld and do whatever it takes to ensure those ingredients are secured in time, or there’ll be hell to pay!
<br>
<br>
Luckily Nate isn’t alone on this quest, his ‘pet’ angel Nugget is there to offer support. Nugget offers his holy insight when needed, but more importantly is chained to Nate, so can be used like a grappling hook or swung around as a weapon. Nate can also equip horns he finds across the world to give him new hellish abilities.
<br>
<br>
Together Nate and Nugget will explore insane environments, meet tons of repugnant characters and witness some truly shocking sights.
<strong>
 <i>Hell Pie</i>
</strong>
is a seriously twisted take on the classic mascot platformer, come along for the ride if you think you can stomach it!

But the death of his best friend Nick calls the former investigative journalist back to confront the town’s troubled past—and his own. He soon becomes drawn into a dangerous web of intrigue as all is not as it seems in the small town of Basswood, West Virginia. Forced to face himself and the townsfolk, Sam struggles to balance the scales of reconciliation and his life-changing investigation. He must decide how much he’s willing to risk to uncover the mysteries of his hometown.

 REMEMBER, REFLECT, REVEAL

Explore Sam’s unique and analytical ways in his expansive Mind Palace, where you can revisit his past, relive old memories, and reconstruct events. There, you can go through possible scenarios, envision how things could’ve gone, and follow the clues to your next lead. Be careful, though—the Mind Palace is a reflection of Sam’s state of mind, for better or worse.

<strong>
 CHOOSE YOUR PATH
</strong>
<br>
<br>
In <i>Twin Mirror</i>, every decision you make alters the course of your investigation, as well as your relationships in Basswood. Trust others or rely only on yourself in your hunt for the truth. But no matter your choices, your story is yours. Take a look in the mirror—what will you see?

The Dark Pictures Anthology is a series of standalone, cinematic branching horror games where the decisions you make in the game determine the story and the outcome you receive.

House of Ashes is the third game in the series.

<br>
In House of Ashes, at the close of the Iraq War, Special Forces hunting for weapons of mass destruction unearth something far deadlier – a buried Sumerian temple containing a nest of unearthly creatures. To survive the night below, they must forge a brotherhood with their enemies from the world above.

 &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen! Come in, come in! In the mood for a story, are we?&quot;
</i>
<br>
<br>
Abby is an artiste held captive at a circus: She spends her days entertaining the audience and her nights in a cage, longing for freedom. One day, she escapes the circus and gets to explore a mystical world.

<br>
<br>
Alas, freedom comes at a cost and Abby soon finds herself dragged into the dangers this world has to offer: In a war-torn, medieval fairytale, surrounded by ravaged, starving citizens and hunted by the relentless cut-throat Tonda, Abby has to cross raging rivers, make it through bandit camps and around traps.
<br>
<br>
Her adventure is always accompanied by the lyrical rhymes of puppet master Jack, who is telling her story while holding the strings of his puppets firmly in his ever-helpful hands.
<br>
<br>
Who can Abby trust? Can she find a way to truly break free? Despite dangling from her threads, will Abby learn that she can still influence her destiny?

Taking inspiration from roguelikes, metroidvanias and monster taming games – <i>Patch Quest</i> is a deceptively difficult genre-defying whirlwind that will lasso you in with its fast-paced gameplay and keep you coming back to expand your monster collection. Do you have the skills to carve a path through this island’s shuffling, patchwork maze?

Patchlantis, once an ancient civilisation has now been fully reclaimed by nature. Fierce monsters, rugged terrain and booby-trapped ruins are all a fact of life, here. Even the island's patchwork terrain will get shuffled each night by a powerful storm!
<br>
When defeated on a run, you’re sent right back to base camp. And while there’s many shortcuts to unlock and countless powerups to earn, there’s still no escaping the facts – you’ll have to get good!

This island is crawling with dangerous monsters. They might look friendly, but behind those adorable googly eyes you’ll find the soul of a vicious predator! Fortunately, you came prepared with your monster-taming Lasso.

You can mount every monster in the game to claim their skills as your own. There’s more than 50 monster species and all of them have a unique set of skills!
<br>
Some of them can fly, or swim, or leap across hazardous terrain. And all of them can pack a serious punch in combat!

 A poker-powered deckbuilding adventure
</strong>
<br>
Three tables stand in a circle of stones in the misty heart of the old woods, forming a portal to a soaring world drawn from the pages of ancient Norse and Middle Eastern mythology. There, you will embark on a journey to save Cardrasil, the Life Tree, from the evil that gnaws at her roots. Each card of the enchanted deck she entrusts to you are leaves plucked from her very branches. Use them to evoke your abilities and unleash devastating, poker-powered attacks. Grow your own power, prune your own deck, but make haste! The seasons are changing; warmth won’t be free for long.

  Manage pod systems down to every single component.

 <li>
  Numerous systems which all have their own unique function and serve to ensure your survival. Every system is interconnected, from the oxygen generator to the emergency lights.
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>
  Over a dozen different components, all having their own specific function and causing different problems when damaged. Ex : Defective buttons won’t trigger properly when pressed, while faulty electrical connectors won’t deliver enough power.
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>
  Organic failures thanks to the simulated nature of resources and components inside the game. You will have to figure out what is wrong and retrace failures back to the source.
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>
  Dismantle, swap and fix anything inside the pod.
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>
  Realistic management of vital resources, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, temperature and radiation. There are no arbitrary numbers here. The levels of these resources required for survival are based on real life!
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>
  An onboard manual providing detailed information about your escape pod.
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>
  Real medical symptoms instead of health bars. For example, hypoxia (lack of oxygen) will make you breathe faster and stronger, will make your vision blurry and will slow down your movements until you fall unconscious.
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>
  Cosmic events will strike your pod and will have different types of impact on its systems. From flying near the surface of a star that will cause overheating to asteroid fields that will pierce your hull, you need to anticipate and deal with the situations as they come to avoid certain death.

 Background:
</strong>
<br>
As a random member of your colony's space program, you leave Mars aboard a large transport ship, only for its reactor to go critical in the middle of your journey to new horizons. All your time spent in the simulator did not prepare you for such a dire situation! Now, drifting in your escape pod, without any FTL capabilities, you realize that an easy way out was not included. Use your own wits to fix systems in a similar way you would fix and build your own PC, by swapping and fixing individual components. With a bit of luck, you might be able to finally find a safe haven.

<br>
In <i>Honey, I Joined a Cult</i> you must build and expand your base, manage your cultists and resources, and increase your faith, funds and following.
<br>
<br>
<img height=&quot;100&quot; src=&quot;https://hb.imgix.net/9f29e21ef6aa1c870f1d2c8e097e634f605b828b.png?auto=compress,format&s=ce217580d1bdbb7dadc2810529cd03fa&quot; width=&quot;616&quot;>
<br>
Every great cult needs great interior design. Place, design and decorate rooms to keep your cultists happy. There is a whole host of weird and wonderful room options, each with a vital role to play in your cult. From polygraph rooms and spirit chambers to energy spas and the dreaded ministry of alteration.
<br>
<br>
<img height=&quot;100&quot; src=&quot;https://hb.imgix.net/8a7db4cabcc228fa33d691c799ed808df35b19ae.png?auto=compress,format&s=52d798cdc343441900647f0080b28933&quot; width=&quot;616&quot;>
<br>
A cult is only as good as its name. Choose yours wisely when picking for your cult, cult leader, the Divine Being that they worship, the Holy Room in which they prove their dedication and the followers that will become the cultists of tomorrow! Make your cult your own by deciding on:
<br>
*A funky symbol
<br>
*A weird uniform to impress would-be followers
<br>
*An imposing hat to make other cults jealous
<br>
*A strange relic to worship and adore
<br>
<br>

<br>
Being snappy dressers isn't enough, your cult must run like a well-oiled hypno wheel. Set schedules for your cultists, level them up and manage food and maintenance systems. Assign tasks to your cultists based on a priority system, who said micro-management doesn't work?!
<br>
<br>
<img height=&quot;100&quot; src=&quot;https://hb.imgix.net/4e1307d44cc3c20e8b2f054449238013e457431f.png?auto=compress,format&s=5cc5530986979db3b40d8f752a796cc1&quot; width=&quot;616&quot;>
<br>
Cultists have needs too and you'll have to ensure that all of yours are fed, watered and having lots of fun! You must take care of your cult's physical and mental well-being to allow them to be the best cult members they can possibly be!
<br>
<br>
<img height=&quot;100&quot; src=&quot;https://hb.imgix.net/bd8c996914e740476d22ebf2471e6b21535cd4ab.png?auto=compress,format&s=e8689883b38c97e3a4b6b4f5c7159140&quot; width=&quot;616&quot;>
<br>
Use all of your charms to recruit followers who will bring in resources and eventually climb through the ranks to become full cultists. Discontented followers will leave, so be sure to turn that frown upside down!
<br>
<br>
<img height=&quot;100&quot; src=&quot;https://hb.imgix.net/5a14d7edc33069de1830050564e692e6c5846d19.png?auto=compress,format&s=11856a84dfcdc8abee728d6d6963531f&quot; width=&quot;616&quot;>
<br>
Your cult leader can be very demanding. Whether it's recruiting specific followers or building certain rooms, be sure to bend to their every whim. Not fulfilling demands will lower thier mood and a displeased leader won't be able to perform effective sermons.
<br>
<br>
<img height=&quot;100&quot; src=&quot;https://hb.imgix.net/441c994259f9716d19fbf5bb38202d57b4bf2d24.png?auto=compress,format&s=a9b043d44b3b357b6dc841f038aae50b&quot; width=&quot;616&quot;>

Cultists can be sent on missions in the local town. Whether it's gathering resources, unlocking new tech or just a demand from your leader, the Covert Ops room is the perfect place to plan!

        <button onclick="showDescription(`<i>Eternal Threads</i> is a single-player, first-person story-driven puzzle game of time manipulation, choice and consequence.
<br>
<br>
As an operative tasked with fixing corruption in the timestream, you have been sent to the North of England in May 2015, where six people died in a house fire. Prohibited from simply stopping the fire, you must instead manipulate the choices made by the housemates in the week leading up to it so that they all survive the event.
<br>
<br>
<video autoplay loop=&quot;loop&quot; muted=&quot;muted&quot; preload=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>

</video>
<br>
<br>
From the outset, you have free and complete reign to explore the seven day timeline before the fire. You can watch and alter the significant events from the entire week as many times as you like and in whatever order you wish. Some decisions will have only minor effects on the timeline, moving objects around the house or revealing deeper stories and secrets. Major changes however, rewrite the timeline by changing existing events, adding new events and even replacing other events entirely.
<br>
<br>

</video>
<br>
<br>
You must traverse up and down this timeline, changing decisions at different moments throughout the week so that their effects interact and combine together to save all six housemates.

</video>
<br>
<br>
However, it is not just the housemates who have choices. Each of them can be saved from the fire in multiple ways, with each outcome having a profound effect on their lives in the future. Will you just search for the quickest and easiest solution, or can you find the best possible outcome for everyone?
<br>
<br>
Ultimately, everything is about choices and consequences.
<strong>
 <br>
 <br>
 Features
</strong>
<br>
<strong>
 <br>
 <br>
 Choose how you want to follow the game’s story
</strong>
<br>
The complete narrative follows the six main characters through multiple decisions across multiple timelines and you can experience these in any way you choose.
<br>
<br>
You can concentrate on just one particular character’s storyline at a time, following their choices across the timelines and then go back to the start and follow another character.
<br>
<br>
You can approach the story like a forensic detective, observe the final outcomes of the story and then work backwards along the timeline – essentially observing the effects and then determining their cause.
<br>
<br>
Or you can just watch things in chronological order, experiencing the timeline unfold as you observe and change the decisions that the characters face as the week progresses.
<strong>
 <br>
 <br>
 Watch and change things as many times as you like
</strong>
<br>
<br>
Can’t remember exactly what happened in an event? Changed a decision and you’re not sure you like the consequences? That’s fine. Just pop back along the timeline and watch and change whatever you like, whenever you like, as many times as you like.
<strong>
 <br>
 <br>
 Change the past to affect the future

Setting up temporary base in the house mere hours after the fire, provides a unique perspective on events. As you look back through the timeline, past events play out in front of you in ghostly form, with the smoke and fire damaged house a constant reminder of what is to come. In addition, as you manipulate the past, the environment can be reset around you to match the changes taking place. Some new objects will appear, others will move around the house and the contents of rooms can change substantially as you change the past.

  <i>Meeple Station</i> is an isometric pixel-art space station building and management sim that takes inspiration from games in the vein of Dwarf Fortress and Rimworld. Build a space station up from bare-bone essentials and a skeleton crew, into a bustling metropolis of activity filled with so many Meeple you'll probably forget about a few of them. You picked a great time to hop on board as we're just dropping our major Planets Update just now, which will have your Meeple expanding across the solar system. It's in an early state, but it's the foundation for a summer full of huge feature releases we've been working on and are very excited to share with you! The big recent changes we've added are also part of the bedrock of what is to come. Heee!
  <strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
   <br>
   <br>
   Meeple need things to live!

  <br>
  Ice can be melted and turned into Oxygen, which assuredly your Meeple will need to continue breathing. They also seem to like regular access to food!  Make sure they have bathrooms near or you're going to end up with one stinky station. Use Meeple for jobs they are well suited to and house them in decent surroundings or the icy fingers of unhappiness will take hold. Just wait until you see the damage an unhappy officer can cause! Once you make your station a nice productive place to live, it's prestige will spread and draw new Meeple to the station and necessitate expansion. Expansion requires more resources, so get to mining! <i>Meeple Station</i> boasts a robust Z-layer system that is seemingly uncommon in many isometric and management games. The system allows up to 32 vertical floors- so stations can get quite gigantic if you so desire.
  <strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
   <br>
   <br>
   Trade!
  </strong>
  <br>
  <br>
  At first, you can get things you need from traders, that you can't effectively manufacture on your own. Once you have a good operation going you can turn the tables and make quite a profit from supplying refined resources and manufactured goods to traders based on their needs. With the Planets Update, we've added the very beginnings of the Player-owned ships system, which we plan to expand on quite a bit in upcoming patches. Assign Pilots to ships and fly construction crews to build new stations. That's right! Multiple stations are new to the Planets patch as well! Now that you can travel around the solar system, you're going to be able to build multiple concurrent stations around different planets.

  Pirates gonna pirate. Maybe they did bad in school and space is hard? Whatever the reason, they want your stuff. That's waaaay easier than doing work themselves. Make sure you have guard Meeple to fight them when they come. Station shields and turrets work wonders against bombers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  We have so many big things in store for the near future that we hope will floor you with their scope. It's a very exciting time over here in the dev team. We work tirelessly to try to get them in your hands as soon as humanly possible, because we're over-excited children and this is our little passion project we can't wait to share with our community. Eventually, we plan on an inter-station ship-based trading, cargo, mining, and exploration network. It's ambitious, but we really can't wait to show you what we've been tossing into the stew for the future!  Seriously, we sit up at night just playing with pixel planets and little tiny shippies. It's a problem.

 <br>
 <br>
 Sophie De Lys
</strong>
<br>
&quot;Soyez prêts !&quot; It's time to meet the French fashionable fast and furious Sophie De Lys and her super moves. One simple advice: choose the right way to go.
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Max Hurricane
</strong>
<br>
With his impressive silhouette, the Canadian champion isn’t here to joke around. He’s ready to blow anything out of his way with only one throw. Klaus Wessel, you’ve been warned.
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Jao Raposa
</strong>
<br>
Absolute fan of Steve Miller, Jao spent his childhood in Brazil watching the original Windjammers’ own his opponents on the jammin’ court, and it’s now his time to shine. His best weapons? His speed and head-spinning throws.
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Sammy Ho
</strong>
<br>
Sammy is a very well balanced athlete. The Chinese player is powerful but fast enough to catch every frisbee that comes to him. Beware of his tricky shots! He’ll take the title away from you if you’re not careful enough!
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img height=&quot;40&quot; src=&quot;https://hb.imgix.net/45e01fb259ff496144aba7b740c75d469fb4d3d3.png?auto=compress,format&s=ce49604a13cb478eb54b497d17d7d168&quot; width=&quot;612&quot;>
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Hiromi Mita
</strong>
<br>
10 years later, you would have thought Japan gave up on the jam? Hiromi Mita is still around with her fast and tricky curve shots shots that will make you regret facing her.
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Klaus Wessel
</strong>
<br>
After a decade of hard training, Klaus Wessel, also known as the Colossus from Germany due to his powerful shots, is back and ready to show Max Hurricane who's the strongest jammer alive.
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Loris Biaggi
</strong>
<br>
Swift, strong, versatile… the Italian Loris Biaggi is still the great champion he was back in the days.
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Steve Miller
</strong>
<br>
He’s agile and a natural at pulling off reversals along with tricky curved shots. He's back to prove that he is still in the game.
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Gary Scott
</strong>
<br>
The extremely muscular American competitor is once again here to show to his opponents how powerful he is. Get ready to see one of the most impressive shots of the game!
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Jordi Costa
</strong>
<br>
The all-round athlete Jordi comes back in the game after 10 years of training. His clinical shots and his speed are the assets that can lead him to win the championship!
<br>

is a game for those, whose biggest dream always was to construct your own house from scratch. Prepare your plan, buy needed materials, and build a perfect residence brick by brick. Will it be an easy task? At first, yes! After all, you’re just a rookie in this serious building industry. A specially made tutorial will guide you step by step through the twists and turns of construction work. However, the more experience you get, the more demanding the challenges become.

Have you finished your little design? Good! Now it’s time to put it into practice. Grab a bunch of bricks, take some cement, roll up your sleeves, and build, construct, and create! Are you afraid it’ll be boring? No, no, no. Nothing like that! You’ll dig the foundation, erect walls, insert windows or doors, and many more. It will not only be exciting, but above all, it will be fun!

You’re very proud of those straight walls and perfect roof… but it’s not over! It’s time to finish this pretty, little house. How? Of course, by polishing its exterior!

Every big construction project starts with a pencil and a piece of paper. And so, it is in the <i>Builder Simulator</i>. You’ll start your work by designing a house on a drawing board. Lines, curves, squares – the whole layout is up to your taste.  The only thing that can hold you back is your own imagination. So use this head of yours and draw the most excellent building of it all! And if you don't have an idea for a design, you can always choose one of the projects we have prepared.

Leaving this creation to rot on your computer would be such a waste, right? That’s why we prepare something special for all our precious players – the Community Builder!

Show your creations, admire the works of people from all over the world and meet other building freaks! Just share your passion and most importantly…

Congrats on your new job! Welcome to the first-person world of a mid-level stockbroker, as you begin your very first day at the trading firm FERIOS. You’ve probably wanted this job since you were six, right? Well, so have a lot of people… so you'll have to fight for it and prove that you're the top dog for the job!
<br>
<br>
Just remember: profit is all that matters, the rules don’t apply if you’re a winner, and only losers feel guilty for the pain, loss and poverty that are the unfortunate but unavoidable by-product of the critical and important work we do here.

It’s simple: your job is to make money for FERIOS.  Buy the stocks going up, sell before they go down. Short the ones that are going to fall (or the ones you’re going to make fall). The more money you make, the bigger your commission. And you want that commission, don't you? Well don’t worry, the rewards are limitless, if you’re hungry enough.

If you’re really smart, you’ll find ways to influence the market to your advantage. Think you can lobby an influential group to affect the market? Do it. Get an opportunity to acquire majority shares to move the needle? Take it.  Drive down the currency of a foreign country to improve the margins of the companies that import their products? Why not? The only consequences that matter are the ones that impact our bottom line.

Every Joe Schmo has access to the regular news. If you want to get ahead of the spikes and crashes you’ll need to find the inside line from more, shall we say, “exclusive” sources. And definitely don’t let those rumors of a financial investigation get you down. No one employed by FERIOS has ever been found guilty!

The fruits of success are yours for the taking. Fast cars, lavish parties, fancy apartments filled with beautiful furniture and artworks. Of course, for any truly successful trader, work is its own reward and their true home is the office so it’s a good thing you can decorate your desk with photos of all your wonderful things to remind you they exist.

<br>
&quot;<i>Monster Prom 2: Monster Camp</i>&quot; brings you more of the world's best (and maybe only?) multiplayer dating sim; but in a way you've never expected!
<br>
<br>
The original Monster Prom is a multiplayer dating sim that shines for its beautiful art and unapologetic humor.
<br>
<br>
The sequel brings you into a new setup (summer camp) with new characters to romance, including old faces and new ones: Damien, Calculester, Milo, Dahlia, Joy and Aaravi. But that's not all, Monster Camp comes with twists here and there: from the campfire mechanics to a new stage full of magic mixed drinks.
<br>
<br>
We're repeating the best from the popular &quot;Monster Prom&quot; formula, but adding some new spices to it. You will see ;)

 <i>The Life and Suffering of Sir Brante</i>
</strong>
is a narrative-driven RPG that comes to life on the pages of the protagonist's journal. Set in a ruthless world where any form of dissent is mercilessly crushed, the story follows a man who has dared to challenge the existing order. Set out on a lifelong journey and become an individual able to carve out their own destiny... But remember that freedom never comes cheap.
<br>
<i>
 <br>
 Life in the Great Arknian Empire is harsh and its hardest Lot is yours by the circumstance of birth. You are a commoner, holding no rights and no title. To seize your fate and become the rightful heir to the legacy of the Brante family you will have to come to grips with ossified tradition and prejudice. Embarking on a life-long journey from one's birth until true death, you will have to endure great upheavals, face adversity, and make many difficult choices. Every decision will affect not only the protagonist, his family, and loved ones, but may even topple the foundation of the Empire itself.

 At the turn of time
</strong>
<i>
 <br>
 Every imperial citizen's life is predetermined by their estate. The deities known as the Twin Gods have bestowed this truth to the world, dividing mortals into Lots. The nobles lead and rule over others, while the clergy guides people on the one true path, and the lowborn suffer, toiling away for the glory of the Empire. You may accept your fate without question, but it is also in your power to change the cosmic order that governs all.

  Your choice is not an illusion

 <br>
 Divided into chapters, the game keeps track of the player's deeds, the skills they acquired, as well as other overlapping circumstances that shape a unique plotline for each playthrough. Every decision has its consequences and you will be held accountable throughout the entire journey. To protect your family and loved ones, to impose the rule of the Emperor and make a fortune, or to try and change the world as you see fit... Make your choice, but beware of the follies of pride and ambition.

 Build Your Village
</strong>
<br>
<br>
When your colonists arrive, they have nothing but the clothes on their backs. You take control and tell them to gather materials and build walls, floors and furniture.
<br>
<br>
You are not limited to predefined buildings! Design your own houses and style them to your liking. There are dozens of construction and furniture elements that you can use to create the settlement you’ve always dreamed of!
<br>
<br>
<img height=&quot;116&quot; src=&quot;https://hb.imgix.net/3048e59205e5c5eaeb317b7137fb3077529afeb9.png?auto=compress,format&s=f2a998a9b09f910e591c1d1727491740&quot; width=&quot;616&quot;>
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Take Care Of Your Villagers
</strong>
<br>
<br>
The villagers are your top priority. At first, you simply need to provide them with food and shelter. But the world is full of dangers! An infection might prove fatal to the strongest warrior and a plague can wipe out your entire settlement.
<br>
<br>
Each villager reacts to events, happy or sad, and reflects that in their behavior. Happy villagers will receive a boost to their productivity – Unhappy villagers might throw a temper tantrum.
<br>
<br>
<img height=&quot;116&quot; src=&quot;https://hb.imgix.net/f5b7031b4654046bd12158917bfd846a48e59154.png?auto=compress,format&s=25c308f339eb0fbad82ba01af66d5936&quot; width=&quot;616&quot;>
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Raise your Family
</strong>
<br>
<br>
Villagers go through a lot together, so they value their friendships very high. Some might even decide to start a family – and you’ll soon be welcoming new members to the group!
<br>
<br>
The little ones are the future of the village, so make sure they have a happy childhood and an adequate education – sometimes achieving both can be difficult.

 <br>
 <br>
 Set up your Farm
</strong>
<br>
Food matters. Good food makes colonists happy, wrong food makes colonists sick, little food makes colonists slow, and no food makes colonists die.
<br>
<br>
Grow a variety of seasonal crops and set up a kitchen to make delicious meals. Be sure to stock up before winter hits and act quick when a swarm of hungry bugs descends upon your fields!
<br>
<br>
<img height=&quot;116&quot; src=&quot;https://hb.imgix.net/532b8c5eb62d53e0c3227cc87c908f5300b5195a.png?auto=compress,format&s=4a43c1073bf4a3eb36b0207c9fd836bd&quot; width=&quot;616&quot;>
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Survive Winter
</strong>
<br>
Use the time you have and make sure you have enough food stored away, for winter is coming. Let’s hope you won’t have to halve rations – because that will make your colonists weak.
<br>
<br>
When supplies dwindle and the freezing cold wind howls outside, it’s easy to lose hope.
<br>
<br>

<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Trade Goods and Get Rich
</strong>
<br>
Word got around that your colony has started producing wares. Greet traveling traders and see if you can get a good deal on some ancient scrolls or buy additional food to prepare for winter.
<br>
<br>
Try to keep production up so you’ll always have something to sell. A mature colony needs to pay good salaries to keep everyone happy. If morale is low, additional funds can even buy a tiny bit of happiness!
<br>
<br>

<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Research Technologies
</strong>
<br>
Building your home is a long process and resources and manpower are not the only things you need. Smart Settlers dedicate a lot of time to researching new technologies, thereby unlocking better equipment, new furniture and construction elements.
<br>
<br>
Select scholars carefully – if their personality doesn’t fit this type of work, they are not going to make a lot of progress.
<br>
<br>

<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Protect Your Outpost
</strong>
<br>
You are not alone in this new land you call ‘home’. Some Tikigoblins living there are not all that happy about your settling efforts and might pay you a visit to try to get you to stop.
<br>
<br>
Train your colonists in the art of warfare and equip them with the best weapons and armor you have. Build walls and towers to ensure the security of your colony – that way, your enemies will have a difficult time trying to mess with you!
<br>
<br>

<br>
The first roguelike in which you play as the devil, which means you can change some of the game's rules to your advantage! Run after run, manage your team of famous evil geniuses as they encounter unforeseen events and turn-based combat. Unlock new skills, create powerful synergies and use your powers to turn the situation in your favour at critical moments. Only by collecting ancient artefacts can you finally take your revenge on the Demon Hunters.

 <br>
 A DARK TALE
</strong>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Weakened from defeat to the forces of good, you fled the world and sought refuge in hell to survive. Decades later, you have returned with your most faithful Disciples to exact revenge on those wretched Demon Hunters. But the world has changed in your absence. Your enemies have become all-powerful, and a new religion – the Sanctua Lumen – has become very influential. It mercilessly hunts down all those who serve you. To reinstate your hold over the world of humans, you must first regain the strength you previously wielded by taking possession of artefacts with legendary power.

The Demon World is inhabited by all kinds of nasties... Most of them lumped into gangs battling for dominion, each led by its own head honcho. Yet even these bad dudes are no match for the Demon King himself! Instead the task falls to Beebz, a young demon barely a thousand years old, who decides it’s time for her to kick every turf leader’s butt and become the Demon Queen herself.

<br>
<br>
In these desperate times, a young soldier will have to face his destiny and embark on an epic journey that will change the fate of Heryon forever…

<br>
<br>
Enrolling in one of the five wings of the CRONUS Corporation - each with its own features, mechanics and game options - and embark on a one way trip inside the Dome in the quest for unique artifacts as you avoid radiation, anomalies and a whole host of creatures out to do you harm.
<br>
<br>
You may start as an ordinary company employee but you will eventually become the driving force behind the narrative that takes place before, during, and after the disaster known as ‘The Incident’.
<br>
<br>
Crafting, combat, negotiation; you’re going to need all your wits about you if you want to survive.

</video>
<br>
<br>
Once you’re familiar with the basics, you are thrust into an open world filled with riches and danger. The old ways are gone – ground into dust by the powerful Maelstrom – and rising from the ashes are six powerful factions, vying for control over the ravaged landscape under the Dome. Will they be allies or enemies? That choice – and the future of the Dome – is in your hands.

<br>
<br>
Not everyone under the Dome is your friend; quite the reverse in fact. If you’re a smart likeable character (with a high charisma rating) you might be able to talk your way out of things. But more likely it’s time for a bit of ultra-violence. And that means weapons; lots of weapons. And there’s no shortage of choice: from high tech beam weapons through to a solid right hook, there’s loads of way to bring down a hostile group of foes. Of course, you can be a pacifist and use non-lethal force but that’s a story for another day…

<br>
<br>
The hostile and unforgiving world can be a lonely place; so why not team up with some like-minded individuals and face the challenges together. From hardened criminals built like mountains or scientists with a shady past, there’s a host of different potential companions to journey with, each replete with their own unique personality and skills.
<br>
<br>
Or you can just go “Lone Wolf” and face everything alone; it’s not an easy road but you can play this way too if you so wish.

<br>
<br>
Encased is full of choices: from what sort of character you will be, what wing you will join and how honourable a person you are. What equipment do you take? How will you fight? Do you craft better weapons or armour?
<br>
<br>
And it doesn’t stop there. You will hold lives in the balance and will have to choose who survives and who perishes.
<br>
<br>

<strong>
 <i>Where the Water Tastes Like Wine</i>
</strong>
is a Narrative-Adventure game about traveling, sharing stories, and surviving manifest destiny. Featuring gorgeous hand-drawn illustrations, <i>Where the Water Tastes Like Wine</i> combines 2D visuals with a 3D overworld US map.
<br>
<br>
Players wander across a folkloric Depression era United States at their own pace, meeting strangers with their own stories to tell. Through these interactions, players will be able to collect unique stories which can then be re-told to unlock new interactions. In this way the in-game stories themselves act as a currency to progress through the game, and it’s up to the player to pair the right story with the unique needs of each of the characters that you will encounter throughout your travels. Only through these right pairings will characters reveal their true selves, and bestow you with the most powerful stories, the true ones which reveal something about their own lives. In <i>Where The Water Tastes Like Wine</i>, stories organically take on a life of their own as they grow larger and transform as they're told- and re-told.

 Game Features
</strong>
<br>
<ul>
 <li>
  &quot;Big Rock Candy Mountain? El Dorado? The place over the hill where they say the water tastes just like the sweetest wine?&quot;: Travel the Depression-Era United States, laboring to pay off a debt by learning the true stories of 16 signature characters across a wide range of American experience from migrant workers to a travelling preacher to a Navajo woman forcibly relocated on the Long Walk.
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>
  &quot;This whole land's built on stories; it's one big story, America is&quot;: As you explore, you'll encounter strange and unsettling things: slices of a country built on dust clouds and murky dreams, where the folk tales are bleeding through. You'll carry those tales with you, swapping them round campfires to make the cast of characters open up to you and share their own stories.
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>
  &quot;The greatest stories are the true ones; the ones people will tell you about their own lives&quot;: The stories you share will return to you along your journey, changed in the telling as they've made their way around the country. As you meet the characters time and again on your travels, they will grow to trust you and, hopefully, share their true selves with you. Only by learning all their real stories can you pay off your debt.

<i>Backbone</i> is inspired by film noir, weird sci-fi, post-soviet aesthetics, modern political regimes, the works of Lynch and Kaufman, and existential philosophy of Sartre. It is a linear, cinematic narrative experience that subverts genre and challenges your perception of what it means to be a person.

<br>
<i>Backbone</i>’s gameplay is focused on storytelling and emotional expression, featuring rich and elaborate dialogues inspired by old school CRPGs, as well as exploration of the lush environments. The end of all things is inevitable, but defining which version of Howard Lotor reaches the conclusion is up to you.
<br>
<br>
As Howard, you will:
<br>
• Make meaningful connections with a diverse cast of characters in pursuit of truth
<br>
• Shape and express your identity through dialogue choices - decide what kind of person you want to be
<br>
• Explore and experience both downtrodden and flourishing districts of a strange, yet familiar version of Vancouver
<br>
• Come to terms with the universal pain of existence and loss
<br>
• Be a raccoon

<strong>
 Post-noir dystopia
</strong>
<br>
<i>Backbone</i>’s Vancouver is a dangerous place, bleak and dreary, but not entirely without hope. It’s a tale of a cold and uncaring world, interspersed with genuine connections and a bruised but undying drive to make a difference. Everyone wants to change the world, but not always for the better.

<i>First Class Trouble</i> is a party game where players must work together and against each other to survive a disaster.
<br>
<br>
Whether you play as one of the human Residents or the rebellious Personoids, you will have to use your wit (and the occasional flying champagne bottle) to stay alive. In <i>First Class Trouble</i> you either deceive or deduce your way to victory in a charming, yet unsettling and often mischievous environment. Whether you do it sober or with a slight buzz, <i>First Class Trouble</i> will serve you a dangerous cocktail of difficult decisions and whacky possibilities.
<br>
<br>
The goal is to shut down the Central Artificial Intelligence Network, also known as CAIN, of the luxurious intergalactic cruise ship ISS Alithea before it and its loyal Personoids take control of the ship.
<br>

<br>
Lie, disrupt and deceive your way through the ship among the residents to either reach CAIN and unleash its full potential or kill off the remaining residents to secure control of the vessel. Use your unique skills to communicate and navigate the ship in the shadows and kill off residents when they pose a threat to your identity.

 Return to the beautiful world of Edo Japan
</strong>
<br>
<br>
Set in Japan around the early Edo period,
<i>
 Aiko's Choice
</i>
is a stealth strategy game that takes place within the story of
<i>
 Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun.
</i>
The expansion focuses on one of the main game's protagonists: the kunoichi adept Aiko. She is a master of camouflage and distracts enemies disguised as a Geisha.
<br>
Although Aiko was certain that she left her old life behind her, Aiko's former sensei, the cunning spymaster Lady Chiyo, reappears from the shadows to challenge her. Together with her deadly companions she sets out to hunt down the ghosts of her past...
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Play a team of five unique assassins
</strong>
<br>
<br>
In the style of the main game, you take control of five skillful assassins, including Aiko, to sneak in the shadows between dozens of enemies. Aiko's companions are just as deadly as her:
<br>
Hayato is an agile ninja, who clears the way silently with his sword and shuriken. The mighty samurai Mugen prefers a more powerful approach and can defeat multiple foes at once. Yuki is a young thief, who places traps and decoys enemies towards their deadly fate. The wise marksman Takuma, however, relies on his sniper rifle and distracts enemies with his loyal pet companion Kuma.

 Disclaimer: You don't require a copy of Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun to play Aiko's Choice. Even though you can enjoy this standalone expansion on its own, we recommend playing at least the first few missions of the main game to get a feeling of the game's mechanics as well as the characters and story!

<br>
We are very happy to finally return to Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun after all these years, and we hope that we were able to convert that joy into this standalone expansion. Join us on another visit… to Japan, early Edo period.

<br>
<i>DEATHLOOP</i> is a next-gen first person shooter from Arkane Lyon, the award-winning studio behind Dishonored. In <i>DEATHLOOP</i>, two rival assassins are trapped in a mysterious timeloop on the island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. As Colt, the only chance for escape is to end the cycle by assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. Learn from each cycle - try new paths, gather intel, and find new weapons and abilities. Do whatever it takes to break the loop.
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 If At First You Don’t Succeed... Die, Die Again
</strong>
<br>
Every new loop is an opportunity to change things up. Use the knowledge you gain from each attempt to change up your playstyle, stealthily sneaking through levels or barreling into the fight, guns-blazing. In each loop you’ll discover new secrets, gather intel on your targets as well as the island of Blackreef, and expand your arsenal. Armed with a host of otherworldly abilities and savage weaponry, you’ll utilize every tool at your command to execute takedowns that are as striking as they are devastating. Customize your loadout wisely to survive this deadly game of hunter vs hunted.

 SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY INJECTED WITH DEADLY MULTIPLAYER
</strong>
<br>
Are you the hero or the villain? You’ll experience <i>DEATHLOOP</i>’s main story as Colt, hunting down targets across the island of Blackreef to break the loop and earn your freedom. All the while, you’ll be hunted by your rival Julianna, who can be controlled by another player. So if you’re feeling devious, you, too, can step into Julianna’s stylish sneakers and invade another player’s campaign to kill Colt. The multiplayer experience is completely optional, and players can choose to have Julianna controlled by AI within their campaign.

 The island Of Blackreef – Paradise Or Prison
</strong>
<br>
Arkane is renowned for magnificently artistic worlds with multiple pathways and emergent gameplay. <i>DEATHLOOP</i> will present a stunning, retro-future, 60s-inspired environment, that feels like a character within itself. While Blackreef may be a stylish wonderland, for Colt it is his prison, a world ruled by decadence where death has no meaning, and delinquents party forever while keeping him captive.

Brave the nightmares of the Quiet Ones. Do not panic…don’t even breathe!
<br>
<br>
<i>Maid of Sker</i> is a first-person survival horror, set in a remote hotel with a gory and macabre history from British folklore. Armed with only a defensive sound device, you’ll utilise stealth tactics to avoid death amongst a cult of sound-based AI enemies.

<br>
<br>
Set in 1898 and inspired by the haunting Welsh tale of Elisabeth Williams, this is a story of a family empire driven by torture, slavery, piracy and a supernatural mystery that suffocates the grounds of the hotel.
<br>
<br>
Created and developed by Wales Interactive with a plot crafted by the writing talent and designers behind the likes of SOMA, Don’t Knock Twice and Battlefield 1.

Then you are in the right place! <br><br><i>shapez</i> is a relaxed game in which you have to build factories for the automated production of geometric shapes. As the level increases, the shapes become more and more complex, and you have to spread out on the infinite map. <br><br>And as if that wasn't enough, you also have to produce exponentially more to satisfy the demands - the only thing that helps is scaling! While you only have to process shapes at the beginning, you will later have to color them - by extracting and mixing colors! <br><br><strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>What people say about <i>shapez</i> </strong> <br><br>

<br>
Berlin, 9th November 1989: The streets are full of people. After four decades of division, thousands of cars are rolling across the inner-German border. The Wall is finally open!
<br>
<br>
At the same time a man disappears in a secret research facility near East Berlin. His goodbye message reaches you too late. You drive back to the office, where the State Security has already destroyed all records of the research project. The complex is deserted and empty.
<br>
<br>
The search for Walter takes you deep into the center of the facility - right into the heart of the universe, where time seems to stand still. The dark secret lurks - well hidden - behind the curtain. In the end, it is horrible insights and the questions of responsibility that make you dive deeper and deeper into a strange, surreal yet familiar world.

 The meteor came. And from it, the survivors learned to harness the power source known as Zygnoka. In the next forty years, the megacity known as The Structure was erected inside the impact crater. Here, the people isolated themselves, accelerating their dependence on technology and created a society as a machine of its own.
 <br>
 <br>
 In The Structure, order and efficiency is maintained by severe top-down control. In the name of efficiency, new machines and instruments are put to use on the public the instant they are invented. In pursuit of optimisation, a new profession is tasked to maintain the increasingly precarious anomaly levels of the city's inhabitants. These are called <i>Mind Scanners</i>.

Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game. <br><br><video autoplay=&quot;autoplay&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; muted=&quot;muted&quot; preload=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;width: 610px; height: 210px;&quot;>

</video> <br>Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate the place to your liking. <br>Just don’t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy what can’t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements. <br><br><video autoplay=&quot;autoplay&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; muted=&quot;muted&quot; preload=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;width: 610px; height: 210px;&quot;>

</video> <br>You don’t need to stay small. You can expand your gas station to be able to serve more customers. Also, a gas station is not just about selling fuel. You can expand the array of services that you offer to your customers and thus attract more and more varied customers. <br>You have various expansion options at your disposal, from smaller ones like providing toilets, a simple shop to complement your income up to big ones like an entire workshop to perform car repairs or even a car wash. There are quite a few choices and most of the expansions can themselves be further expanded upon as well. There is so much you can do here. <br><br><video autoplay=&quot;autoplay&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; muted=&quot;muted&quot; preload=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;width: 610px; height: 210px;&quot;>

</video> <br>Restoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch another. The game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have already built and lots of decorations to further enhance the uniqueness of the place. Some decorations can be bought, others have to be acquired during gameplay. <br>It is not just about making the gas station look nice. The more impressive your gas station looks, the more customers will be attracted. <br><br><video autoplay=&quot;autoplay&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; muted=&quot;muted&quot; preload=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;width: 610px; height: 210px;&quot;>

</video> <br>Serving your customers is key in running your gas station with success. They all expect to have their cars filled up, their shopping done right away and aren’t that patient even when it comes to repairs of their vehicles. You are going to be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and have to schedule various tasks for when it’s less hectic. Proper time management and choosing the right priorities becomes very important when it comes to keeping your customers happy. <br><br><video autoplay=&quot;autoplay&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; muted=&quot;muted&quot; preload=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;width: 610px; height: 210px;&quot;>

</video> <br>While you can try, it most cases running a gas station that has been expanded and upgraded offering lots of different services to your customers might be just too much to handle for you alone. This is where employees come into play. You can hire even multiple employees to help you with the various tasks at the gas station. Employees have their own skills and some are better at some tasks than others. Employees also level based on the tasks they perform and become better at them with time. <br><br><video autoplay=&quot;autoplay&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; muted=&quot;muted&quot; preload=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;width: 610px; height: 210px;&quot;>

</video> <br>You can’t sell what you don’t have. Keeping track of your stock is important and ordering at the right time for the right price helps to keep profits up. To even better use low price opportunities, you can build a warehouse and expand it to allow for larger storage. Keeping a close eye on your stock is crucial as deliveries take time and you really don’t want to run out of goods to sell, not to mention fuel. <br><br><video autoplay=&quot;autoplay&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; muted=&quot;muted&quot; preload=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;width: 610px; height: 210px;&quot;>

22 years ago the USSR and the Western Bloc destroyed each other in a nuclear inferno. Millions died instantly, society collapsed and technology was sent back into the Middle Ages. You are a member of ATOM – an organization tasked with protecting the post-apocalyptic remnants of humanity.
<br>

Two years ago you – a rookie agent of ATOM – were sent on a dangerous mission into the Soviet Wastes. As a result, you uncovered certain information about a new threat that can potentially destroy the struggling remnants of humanity.

 <i>Yes, Your Grace</i>
</i>
tells a tale of Davern, a medieval kingdom ruled by King Eryk. The game is set in a fictional world where monsters and arcane practices inspired by Slavic folklore are the order of the day. Villagers will ask for your help with various problems, from monsters attacking the village to a lack of places to relax and enjoy themselves. Some will bring humour to your throne room and some will present you with difficult choices. Your family is important too, and throughout your time as King, you will have to support them in their struggles.
<br>
<br>
You will face lords with a variety of personalities; you will need their support in order to win an upcoming battle, but some may ask you to perform dirty deeds to cement the alliance. One thing is clear: It won’t be easy to keep everyone happy...

 THESE WALLS CAN’T FALL
</strong>
<br>
<br>
Set in the medieval world of Gloria Victis, <i>Siege Survival: Gloria Victis</i> sees your country invaded and your city under brutal siege.
<br>
<br>
A small group of civilians are trapped in the only remaining stronghold and are the last source of hope for the defending troops hanging on for dear life. You might not be fighting the invaders yourself, but the fate of the city lies in your hands.
<br>
<br>
Support the last soldiers standing against overwhelming enemy forces and hold out until reinforcements arrive. Build your camp, manage resources, craft supplies during the day and scour the fallen city for resources and new civilian recruits at night.
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 SURVIVE THE SIEGE
</strong>
<br>
Defending what’s left of your city are a few tired troops in dire need of arrows, weapons and armour; along with treatment for the wounded. You need to keep this last bastion of defenders supplied and supported in every way possible ahead of their battles every few days; otherwise, the enemy will eventually storm the keep. Not only that, but you also need to protect your civilians and your camp, as you are assaulted by waves of flaming arrows and giant boulders.
<br>

 <br>
 <br>
 MANAGE RESOURCES & CRAFT SUPPLIES
</strong>
<br>
You need better weapons, a roof over your head, hot food and all the other trappings that just existing entail; and the only way you’ll get these is if you and your team craft them. But resources are limited and you'll need to sustain both soldiers and civilians, so find ways to preserve food, develop your infrastructure and use your supplies more efficiently.

<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 SCAVENGE THE FALLEN CITY
</strong>
<br>
Venturing out from the safety of your keep, you have to explore the ransacked city at night to collect precious resources and help the surviving citizens – or exploit them. But be careful, enemy patrols keep watching the streets; you must be smart to remain unseen... and alive. Unlock routes to other districts, enlist new civilian recruits and make it back before dawn so as not to be caught.

 <br>
 YOUR BACK AGAINST THE WALL
</strong>
<br>
Help is coming, but it’s weeks away. And in a siege like this, one dilemma can quickly spiral into another and very soon you will face tough moral choices. The fate of your companions - and that of the city - is in your hands alone. There will be hunger, wounds, disease and despair, but also growing tensions between the civilians and defenders. Sustain your troops or keep your civilians alive? Only you can decide.

  <strong>
   Uncover the Secrets of the Pandoravirus:
  </strong>
  Engage with a complex narrative, complete with multiple endings that the player can only uncover via several playthroughs. Explore, research, and discover a secret history, as you learn about the origins of the mutants, the Pandoravirus, and Phoenix Point itself.

  <br>

  <strong>
   Manage Diplomatic Relations:
  </strong>
  The Phoenix Project is not the only organization trying to reclaim the Earth. The militaristic New Jericho, the mystical Disciples of Anu, and the technophiles of Synedrion all offer unique rewards for co-operation and threats for opposition. It is up to you to decide how, or even if, to deal with them.

  </strong>
  Phoenix Point was designed by Julian Gollop, the creator of the X-COM series in the 1990s. Integrating the core ethos of X-COM while updating the visuals, technology, and systems to modern standards has made Phoenix Point best-in-class.

Or why not train adventurous mages, offering them options to learn how to fight and be stealthy? But this will require surviving the ruthless attacks of the orc tribes and the controls of the education authorities.

 MEET THE <i>CHICKEN POLICE</i>

Sonny Featherland and Marty MacChicken were once a legendary detective-duo, the <i>Chicken Police</i>. But that was almost a decade ago, and time had passed them by... Now, Sonny is just a semi-alcoholic wreck of a bird on his paid leave, while Marty still hides behind the facade of a star-detective.
<br>
During their last case, they nearly killed each other, and they haven't spoken ever since...
<br>
<br>
Now Sonny and Marty are forced to work together on a case that's weirder and wilder than anything they've ever encountered before!

 CLAWVILLE NEVER SLEEPS
</strong>
<br>
<i>
 &quot;This city never sleeps - they say.
 <br>
 Maybe that's why it is so cranky all the time.&quot;
</i>
<br>
<br>
The city of Clawville was built as an Edenic place, where predators and prey can live in peace. But the dream remained just a dream while Clawville slowly became the darkest corner of all the Wilderness.
<br>
<br>
<i>Chicken Police</i> is a satire, which recalls the mood and atmosphere of the 40's film-noir classics, and as the best noirs and hardboiled detective stories, it's so gritty and hopeless, that it can only be served with a lot of cynical humor...

 <strong>
  FORBES:
 </strong>
 <i>
  &quot;It's also clear from the trailer that its dark story will be pretty funny, with plenty of scope to establish it as one of the more unique releases in its genre. Needless to say, there'll be absolutely nothing like it released during 2020, and hopefully, it'll be as brilliant as it is different.&quot;
 </i>
 <br>
 <br>
 <strong>
  DESCTRUCTOID:
 </strong>
 <i>
  &quot;I know I mostly cover animal-based games, but few have ever stopped me dead in my tracks like this one. I mean, did you hear that song in the trailer? That's original music, baby! I'm a sucker for games with quirky themes and original music, so of course, I took notice to this one straight away. Mix that with the animals-as-people motif and spot-on detective visuals, and yeah I didn't really stand a chance.&quot;
 </i>
 <br>
 <br>
 <strong>
  ROCK PAPER SHOTGUN:
 </strong>
 <i>
  &quot;Fortunately I’m batting my jet-lagged eyes at <i>Chicken Police</i>, an upcoming noir detective adventure with grizzled chickens and a very good raccoon. It’s a point and clicker, which means I’ll almost certainly never play it. But I’d still like you to revel in this trailer with me. It’s a cinematographic masterpiece.&quot;
 </i>
 <br>
 <br>
 <strong>
  ALPHA BETA GAMER:
 </strong>
 <i>
  &quot;It really nails the film noir vibe it’s going for. Meanwhile, the voice acting is excellent throughout, the story is interesting and the writing is very witty, packed full of cynical humor and animal-based puns. A ridiculous and riveting hardboiled detective adventure that will give you a clucking good time.&quot;

</strong>
is a hardcore FPP slasher packed with lightning-fast action, set in a grim, cyberpunk megastructure. Climb Dharma Tower, humanity’s last shelter, after a world-ending cataclysm. Make your way up from the bottom to the top, confront the tyrannical Keymaster, and take your revenge.

<br>
<br>
The streets of this tower city are full of violence. Mara the Keymaster rules with an iron fist and little regard for human life.
<br>
<br>
As resources diminish, the strong prey on the weak and chaos threatens to consume what little order remains. The decisive last stand is coming. A final attempt to set things right before mankind goes over the edge of extinction.
<br>
<br>
As the most advanced blade fighter ever created, you’re always outnumbered but never outclassed. Slice your enemies with a monomolecular katana, dodge bullets with your superhuman reflexes, and employ a variety of specialized techniques to
<br>
prevail.

<i>Ghostrunner</i> offers a unique single-player experience: fast-paced, violent combat, and an original setting that blends science fiction with post-apocalyptic themes. It tells the story of a world that has already ended and its inhabitants who fight to survive.

Obtain weapons and gears with unique characteristics that affect the skills of your hero.

But this party would not be complete without the main course: the enemies. Hordes and waves of disturbing enemies will make their way to you, clawing and bitting till there's nothing left. But do not worry, you will be fine. It is the bosses which will make you tremble. More than 15 bosses will put you to the test, each with different sets of mechanics and unique ways to be beaten.

One day, a letter signed by him is received, claiming he’s on an uninhabited island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.

As we follow Dysis’s adventure, questions will start to be answered little by little.

 THE STORY
</strong>
<br>
Your Peeps have spent generations underground. They’ve missed the caress of sun on skin, the squelch of soil between toes, the tickle of flies on noses. They emerge, full of wonder, but with no idea how to grow anything - except potatoes. Start rebuilding their lost civilisation by providing shelter, uncovering ancient technology, and expanding this reborn society to other continents and planets.

<br>
<br>
But the universe is not safe. Ancient, ancestral guardians demand attention and challenge your settlements - it’s up to you to circumvent these creatures that hamper progress and disturb your newfound peace.
<br>
<br>

There are no weapons, no battles with neighbours for control of resources - just you, and a solar system full of opportunities.

<br>
<br>
Test your mettle against the most fearsome of all Varkids. Her name has long been whispered in blood-soaked legend; now Hemovorous the Invincible has awoken. This colossal raid boss has made her lair on Pandora, and only the fiercest big game hunters have a chance of kicking her chitinous butt in the pursuit of top-tier loot. Better bring some friends to this fight and be ready to get caked in Varkid guts—it's going to get messy!
<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Ava is convinced she has a lead on some potentially supernatural slayings and has decided to document her findings in serialized podcast form. Consider yourself her gun-toting co-host as you investigate strange happenings on Pandora, Promethea, Eden-6, and Nekrotafeyo in search of answers (and loot) with the help of some familiar faces.
<br>
<br>
In the Director’s Cut, Vault Hunters can scour the galaxy to solve a string of murders, score loot with three new Vault Cards, and enjoy never-before-seen insights into the development of Borderlands 3. You can also peruse Borderlands 3's beginnings, bloopers, and cut content with a compilation of behind-the-scenes selections. And that’s not all! You can also explore a gallery full of concept art, storyboards, lost maps, and footage of Borderlands 3 from throughout its development.
<br>
<br>
Included in the Director’s Cut are three Vault Cards, which are your ticket to upcoming bundles of themed loot! Once the Vault Cards are released, they can be activated and leveled up to unlock a bevy of cosmetics plus some supremely powerful gear. The first Vault Card will debut with the launch of Director's Cut, featuring items that honor some of Borderlands' most beloved fallen heroes. When multiple Vault Cards are available, you'll have the option to select which one you want to be active.

This content requires Borderlands 3 to play and is included in Season Pass 2. The first of the three Vault Cards included in Director's Cut is now available, with the remaining two scheduled to launch by the end of 2021.

Lead a rag-tag squad of cops in rebellion against their town's new criminal power, and see how long you can hold out when you're constantly short on supplies, and a single shot can cost a cop his life.<br/><br/><video preload=&quot;auto&quot; autoplay=&quot;autoplay&quot; muted=&quot;muted&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 337px;&quot;>

</video><br><br><strong>You’re not exactly the police, but you're the only ones on the side of justice</strong><br>Viktor Zuev, a sadistic crime boss new on the scene, has quickly taken the town of Ripton by the throat. The community's leaders and even the local police have surrendered to his will. A master of intimidation and blackmail, Zuev has seized every major business in town, all of which he now controls as his own private fiefdom. But an outlaw band of renegade cops refuse to bow. With little hope of success, they fight on -- for justice, and the soul of their town.<br/> <br/><video preload=&quot;auto&quot; autoplay=&quot;autoplay&quot; muted=&quot;muted&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 337px;&quot;>

</video><br><br><strong>Gunfights are thrilling, but stealth is key</strong><br>You're fighting a guerilla war, out-manned and out-gunned. Use concealment and cover, approach the enemy quietly, and take them down before they can raise the alarm. You have at your disposal an arsenal of non-lethal weapons and equipment, as well as special tactical perks, which you can unlock as you upgrade your rebels. True, sometimes violence seems inevitable, but when the time comes, don't hesitate: neither you nor the criminals have health bars. When someone is shot, they'll bleed out quickly, and getting a bullet in the head means instant death.<br/><br/><video preload=&quot;auto&quot; autoplay=&quot;autoplay&quot; muted=&quot;muted&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 337px;&quot;>

Search each room, crack open safes and vaults, try to get into inaccessible areas -- and grab everything that looks useful. Stay together and proceed with caution, or accept the risks, fan out, and try to explore every corner.<br/><br/><img src=&quot;https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/970960/extras/GIF_04.gif?t=1567770360&quot;/><br><br><strong>Take the high road, or the low road</strong><br>Zuev's mercilessness is the key to his power. Can you defeat him without playing by his rules? Will you answer the needs of the desperate townspeople, even if it means putting the whole operation at risk? Will you spare civilian guards who are only doing their jobs? Some say that in war, you have to do whatever it takes to survive, but remember: reputation is more valuable than money. Bad blood on the street can easily put your good name in the mud. Merchants will refuse to do business with you, and even some of your own people might turn their backs on you.<br/><br/><video preload=&quot;auto&quot; autoplay=&quot;autoplay&quot; muted=&quot;muted&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px; height: 337px;&quot;>

 Neon lights, palm trees, synthwave, '80s supercars speeding down an endless highway... Welcome to the world of <i>Retrowave</i>!
</strong>
<br>
<br>
Listening to Synthwave / <i>Retrowave</i> most people have had this feeling of nostalgia for an era they didn't know or that never existed.
<br>
The <i>Retrowave</i> is very much inspired by the '80s, but is mostly an idealized futuristic version of the '80s.
<br>
<br>
This game offers the player the unique experience of being immersed in this wonderful world for at least a few moments...
<br>
<br>
In <i>Retrowave</i> you will first start with one car, then you will be able to upgrade it or buy other cars with the money earned at the end of each run.
<br>
Race your car through different unique worlds!
<br>
Watch out for other vehicles on the road (yes, even in the future there will be traffic).
<br>
<br>
<i>Retrowave</i> offers above all a visual and sound experience that will delight fans of the genre and will surely make those who don't know it yet discover this wonderful universe...

<br>
In <i>Fling to the Finish</i>, teams of two players race through colorful, chaotic obstacle courses while tethered by a stretchy elastic rope.
<br>
<br>
When you and your friends first pick up the game your rope will get tangled in practically everything you pass. But as you quickly improve your communication skills you'll learn that the rope is your biggest asset.
<br>
<br>
Experienced players can use the rope to swing around perilous obstacles, and fling their partner up ledges before they fall to their doom. When partners master using their rope, they're capable of acrobatic feats unachievable in any other platformer!
<br>
<br>
Teams can show off their skills by competing in online or local races with a bunch of other players!
<br>
<br>
<img height=&quot;220&quot; src=&quot;https://hb.imgix.net/209fe906f1289812a6166602595d16bde6824d8d.png?auto=compress,format&s=d942cb53d9caa71f3f48cb66274b1d3f&quot; width=&quot;616&quot;>
<br>
Because you're literally attached to your partner, <i>Fling to the Finish</i> is a truly cooperative experience. If you want, you can even play through <i>Fling to the Finish</i> by sharing a controller with your partner.
<br>
<br>
This control scheme is great for local co-op, and adds an extra dimension to the game. While you push and pull each other in game, try not to do the same in real life!

<br>
Every course in <i>Fling to the Finish</i> has a unique theme and style. Race through floating parks, giant casinos, and even worm filled asteroid fields to reach the finish line! We designed every obstacle to force you to use the rope in a new way, so every second is filled with new surprises and memorable moments. The race track even evolves to challenge you as you play, so every race is a nail biter. You'll never know what weird obstacle you'll find next.

In battles with up to 100 real-world combatants, players will have to contend with large open maps and tight claustrophobic trenches. Utilizing both period-appropriate guns and a more tactical close-quarters melee combat system, the action in <i>Beyond the Wire</i> is more comprehensive than anything seen in a WW1 game to date.
<br>
<br>
<i>Beyond the Wire</i> is now entering Early Access, with its wider release scheduled for 2022. Be sure to follow us for development updates and information about new content. We thank everyone that participated in our Closed Alpha!

 A Unique Melee System

 Massive Multiplayer Action
</strong>
<br>
100 players at a time face off in 50v50 tactical combat, with an emphasis on methodical bolt action rifle combat and the brutal scale of action soldiers faced on the front lines of the Great War.

 Tense & Chilling Trench Warfare

It’s muddy, it’s bloody, it’s gruesome. Tight corners, waves of bayonets on all sides, and limited vision - this game shows off Trench Warfare at its worst. Are you up to the challenge?

<strong>
 <i>DUE PROCESS</i>
</strong>
is a tactical FPS where tactics finally matter.
<strong>
 Planning & teamwork
</strong>
are essential for victory because every map is
<strong>
 procedurally generated
</strong>
. You'll be faced with a new challenge every time you play.
<br>

Fresh maps make <i>Due Process</i> great. Levels are built in-house via a procedurally assisted level generation process and are
<strong>
 delivered weekly via steam update
</strong>
, which means you won't be playing on the same stale level. Our level designers edit each level before it goes out and are constantly trying new concepts.

<strong>
 Teamwork starts with a goal.
</strong>
Discuss your strategy over voice chat, and use the
<strong>
 planning phase
</strong>
to draw up a plan of attack. Deploy your assets wisely over the course of three rounds, as anything fielded from your armory won't come back if destroyed or lost.

<strong>
 No plan survives first contact.
</strong>
The plan is a start, but you're going to have to think on your feet and coordinate with your team when things go awry. Getting your teammate to open fire to cover your footsteps just might secure you the element of surprise.

<br>
A corporate military force contracted with enforcing indefinite martial law. Armed with the best tactical gear and weapons for a CQB environment.
<strong>
 Speed, surprise, and violence of action
</strong>
are the essential elements of good execution. Once a plan is made, move forward with purpose, either by systematically eliminating the opposition room by room, or by striking swiftly at the heart of the defense.

<br>
A rag-tag band of outlaws who oppose the corporations by any means necessary. Their weapons and gear are relics and rudimentary, but are not to be underestimated.
<strong>
 Cunning is their strength
</strong>
. Anticipate what the enemy is planning, then set up the kill zone. Lay traps, coordinate crossfire with your team, and exploit breaks in the attack to flank the enemy and bring a decisive end to the fight.

The year is 1983 and the United States of America must defend itself from an enemy it could have never imagined— an America from an alternate universe that will stop at nothing to seize control of the country’s heartland!
<br>
<br>
In
<strong>
 Möbius Front ‘83
</strong>
you will fight tactical, turn-based battles with the cutting-edge military hardware of the early 1980s. Use every tool available -- powerful tanks, fast-moving attack helicopters, long-ranged artillery, tenacious infantry, and more -- to control the complex and rapidly-changing battlefield of the era.
<br>
<br>
Who are the “Americans” attacking America, and why? Find out in the game’s extensive single-player campaign and its fully voiced cutscenes. When you’re ready for some R&R, play a new kind of solitaire, solve Zachtronics-style puzzles, and even read the U.S. military manuals that inspired the game.
<br>
<br>
MULTIPLAYER & SOVIET ARMY UPDATE: You can now also play one-off skirmish missions against the AI or your Steam friends using the armies from the campaign and the newly added Soviet Army faction. Complete the single-player campaign and unlock the ability to play as the enemy in multiplayer!

Over time, the more we added, the more SimpleRockets 2 outgrew its name. With much consideration we have decided to change the name to &quot;Juno: New Origins&quot; - a title that symbolizes a new start.</span></p>

Complete contracts to earn money, and discover a mixture of hand-crafted and procedural contracts that offer countless hours of new gameplay. Conquer milestones and explore landmarks to earn tech points and unlock new technology in the tech tree. Interactive tutorials are available to show how to build and operate rockets, cars, and airplanes.<br><br></span></p>

<p><span>Engines can be adjusted in a myriad of ways, such as changing the power cycle, combustion pressure, gimbal range, fuel type, and adjusting nozzle performance and visuals. You can customize an engine to be a power house for lift off, or to be a super optimized vacuum engine that maximizes Isp for interplanetary travel. The engine's performance affects its visuals in flight too as shown by the exhaust's expansion or contraction based on its interplay with the atmospheric pressure. Shock diamonds are pretty but they are a symptom of suboptimal engine performance! If you don't care about any of this, then you can just attach a pre-built engine and hit launch!<br><br></span></p>

<strong>
 Gameplay
</strong>
<br>
In BPM, all of your actions and the actions of your enemies are tied to the beat of the music. Your enemies perform a dance-like sequence of attacks to an epic rock opera. BPM is inspired by retro shooters of the 90’s. It is fast, frenetic and rhythmical. You can double jump, dash, rocket jump and bunny hop to evade your opponents.
<br>
<br>
Your goal is to reach the end of randomly generated dungeons, collecting different weapons, abilities and items each time you play. These weapons and abilities can radically alter the way you play, making each playthrough unique.
<br>
<br>
You must defeat 7 bosses to reach the final boss. Each boss moves and attacks in a unique way that you must learn to exploit if you want to succeed. Some attacks require you to jump over fields of lava, some to dodge fast projectiles, some to hold fast for a beat.

   Black Future ’88
  </strong>
  is a Synth-Punk roguelike 2D action Shooter. Vertically climb an always evolving procedural tower to reach the top and kill its insane owner…before your heart explodes. Shoot, slash, dash and upgrade yourself to survive the endless waves of deadly traps, homicidal AI, crazed junkies and colossal Wardens standing in your way in a stylish alternative version of 1988.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world is reeling from a nuclear cataclysm, created by Duncan, the tower architect. The First of his bombs fell in the summer of 1988, and by December they had blacked-out the sun with endless rain. We decided to stop keeping time after this, and it’s been 1988 ever since. Everything that lived through the initial attack will die in the extreme floods that followed.  These are the times after, where there are no more months, or even weeks…everything is measured in minutes left to live.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Take on the mantle of one of the last remaining misfit survivors, and fight your way to the top of the tower to kill the architect and stop the endless nuclear rain. Ascend to die, and die to survive.

  Inspired by the rise of fake news, social media echo chambers, and the displacement of truth, <i>Orwell: Ignorance is Strength</i> is the second--darker--season of the award-winning surveillance thriller, Orwell. With the power to both uncover and play with &quot;the truth&quot;, you must decide for yourself how far you will go in the service of your country and whether the truth is sacred or ignorance is strength.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inducted into “The Office”--a top-secret department of the government’s Orwell security program--you’ll take on the role of an investigative agent during a time when civil unrest threatens to become a major political crisis between the Nation and neighboring country Parges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reporting directly to Orwell adviser, Ampleford, you‘re tasked with uncovering the truth behind the escalating political tension, and delving deep into the lives of Raban Vhart, editor of The People’s Voice and self-proclaimed guardian of truth, his wife, Karen, and his brother, Illya, to uncover their potential involvement.
  <br>
  <br>
  To assist you in your task, you will be given new tools and mechanics that provide opportunities to control and impact the narrative. A new “time of day” system puts you in time-sensitive situations, making who you chose to investigate and when, more important than ever. You can also research more widely and dig deeper into citizen’s lives, gathering additional information to influence the way events are reported and perceived by the public.

 Story
</strong>
<br>
Aliya Elasra is an archaeologist, exploring a strange region of space called the Nebula with her robot sidekick Six, hoping to uncover the secrets of the long-forgotten past. When a roboticist from the University of Iox goes missing, Aliya begins a trail of discoveries that will lead to the very edge of her world - and the ancient secret of <i>Heaven's Vault</i>.

 <br>
 Gameplay
</strong>
<br>
<i>Heaven's Vault</i> is not your usual linear adventure game. Progress through the game in any order you choose - the game's fully adaptive narrative remembers every choice you make, every discovery and every action you take, influencing what happens next. Meet a diverse cast of characters who remember everything you say, and who's attitude to you will change with how you act. Some are friendly, some are cautious, and some are out to trick you.
<br>
<br>
Who will you trust? What will you find? What will you learn? What will you risk? What will you lose?
<br>
<br>
<ul>
 <li>
  Explore ancient sites, discover lost ruins
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>
  Find artefacts and translate their strange hieroglyphics
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>
  Sail an open-world of fast flowing space-rivers
  <br>
 </li>
 <li>
  Piece together the history of the world and an entire ancient language

  Diverse cast of characters that remember everything you say
 </li>
</ul>
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Translate Ancient Hieroglyphs
</strong>
<br>
An entire ancient hieroglyphic language awaits to be deciphered. A puzzle mechanic with a twist: solutions are narratively significant and further the story - but the wrong translation might send you down the wrong track!

 A roguelike deck-building game
</strong>
<br>
<i>Nowhere Prophet</i> is a single player card game with procedurally generated maps, a high difficulty and permadeath. At it's heart are two distinct parts of gameplay: Travel and combat.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>
 TRAVEL
</strong>
<br>
During travel you navigate across a procedurally generated map. Make sure your convoy has enough resources to travel as you pick your route. On your journey you will encounter strange places and even stranger people. You will be thrust into situations that put the fate of your followers in your hands.
<br>
<br>
If you're lucky enough to gain some rewards, maybe for helping someone - or robbing them, then you can invest those to improve your decks. Recruit more followers to have more and different units to put into battle. Equip your prophet or level up and learn new skills to have access to stronger action cards in combat.
<br>
<br>
<strong>
 COMBAT
</strong>
<br>
You will have to overcome some enemies to keep your convoy and resources together. And sometimes you may even want to pick a fight for righteousness or just for loot. Once in battle the game changes to the turn-based card game mode.
<br>
<br>
Play convoy cards to put your followers onto the field and position them so you can overcome your enemy. Or play action cards to dramatically change the battlefield. But be careful: If you're wounded you will have to find a safe place to heal. And if one of your followers takes too many wounds, they are lost forever.
<br>
<br>

<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 A science-fiction post-apocalypse
</strong>
<br>
<i>Nowhere Prophet</i> is set on a far off planet called Soma. Your story begins many years after the Crash, a complete technological collapse. Civilization has broken down and the lack of resources made everyone turn either bandit or madman.
<br>
<br>
<br>
In this world inspired by Indian culture you lead a convoy of outcastes. These desperate men and woman following your vision of a better future. Under your guidance they travel with you through the wastelands. Your goal is the Crypt, a mystical place that promises untainted technology and safety.
<br>
<br>
If you can survive long enough to find it.

  For every attempt to save the world, you need to find the best combination of objects, special abilities, and weapons. You must use what you get. Endless airstrikes or an army of rats? There are many paths to Rome, but you decide.

  The cities are created procedurally, allowing for endless combinations. Plunder the cities as quickly as possible, otherwise an exploding zombie might blast you to pieces, or a zombie on steroids might stomp you to dust. Be careful! Very dangerous hordes of zombies await in the night.

<br>
Paradise is an island that regenerates every few millennia. The psychic power that the alien worshipers within release into the universe is meant to feed and eventually resurrect their fallen deities. But this force also attracts undesired interest from demons, who eventually corrupt each island — until a new alternate reality is birthed by the Council.
<br>
<br>
The system isn’t perfect, but it will be one day — on Perfect 25, the next island-to-be. But on the eve of rebirth, the Council is murdered and Paradise is killed.
<br>
<br>
In the aftermath, the “investigation freak” Lady Love Dies is summoned from exile to find the culprit. This is the crime to end all crimes.
<br>
<br>
What are the facts? What are the truths? Are they the same?

  <i>Going Under</i> is a satirical dungeon crawler about exploring the cursed ruins of failed tech startups. As an unpaid intern in the dystopian city of Neo-Cascadia, you’ll wield office junk as weaponry as you make your way through the offbeat procedural dungeons beneath your company campus.
  <strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>

   <br>
   The Future is Wack
  </strong>
  <br>
  <br>
  Failed businesses no longer just cease to exist--they sink beneath the earth, and their employees are cursed to wander the halls for eternity as monsters. It’s your duty to put these monsters out of their misery and repossess their assets--so that your boss can afford a new car, or something.
  <strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
   <br>
   <br>
   Not All Heroes Get Paychecks
  </strong>
  <br>
  <br>
  Battle through the remains of failed startups themed off of gig workers, dating sites, and cryptocurrency. Uncover the true motives of your employer, a carbonated drink startup known as Fizzle, and their parent company, a subscription box manufacturer with an army of helpful shipping drones. Make friends with your co-workers! Hire a freelance goblin! Date a slime! Invest in crypto! Set a rideshare on fire!

  In the dungeons of <i>Going Under</i>, almost everything can be used as a weapon, from laptops to brooms to body pillows. Proper weapons can be found as well, but even they can break at a moment’s notice if you aren’t careful. Playing cautiously and picking the right weapon for the situation are musts if you intend on surviving your internship.
  <strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
   <br>
   <br>
   Horrible Bosses

  <br>

  And you thought your boss was a monster. At the bottom of the dungeons lurk the founders of the cursed startups, getting rich off of investments while their employees fight amongst themselves. Defeat them and return to the surface with their enchanted relics to empower the company you work for.

  <br>
  <i>Panzer Paladin</i> is an action-platformer game featuring intuitive swordplay mechanics. The protagonist pilots the Paladin power armor to fight giant demons by using their own weapons against them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swordplay is the core of the game mechanics in <i>Panzer Paladin</i>. The player can equip and use any weapon dropped by defeated enemies, attack or block, aim high or low, use weapons advantageously through a rock-paper-scissors style weapon type system, and cast spells by breaking weapons. Weapons abound in levels, so the player is encouraged to use them profusely. The Paladin is the main way to fight enemies, but players can also eject and control Flame, the small-but-swift Squire pilot. Flame uses a laser whip to attack enemies, swing across gaps, and even recharge the Paladin’s energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  <img height=&quot;71&quot; src=&quot;https://hb.imgix.net/3fe4f195d4fd660f2f46408fb111509028303874.png?auto=compress,format&s=96dd4a8deb266370b06a55d8d93c88e8&quot; width=&quot;612&quot;>
  <br>
  Giant weapons — swords, lances, hammers — hailing from the dark depths of space, blazed across the sky and pierced their way through historic locations all around the world. As a declaration of war against mankind, the Parthenon, atop the Acropolis of Athens, was first to be cut through by an ominous blade. Upon impact, each of the weapons opened a breach in the fabric of reality and unleashed legions of colossal demons.
  <br>
  <br>
  In anticipation of such unforeseen Earth-threatening events, the International Security Council formed Gauntlet, a science committee developing super-sophisticated defense technologies. Gauntlet discovers that denizens of the Netherworld can only be defeated by their own weapons. Spirit Weapons are forged with spirits of the deceased and humans can’t brandish them without becoming corrupted by their foul energy... However, a machine would be immune to demonic corruption! Gauntlet recommissions Flame, a former rescue operations android, to become a Squire. She takes control of Grit, the last remaining Paladin unit — a state-of-the-art suit of power armor capable of wielding Spirit Weapons.
  <br>
  <br>
  To arms! Overseeing operations from aboard the Avalon, their flying headquarters, Gauntlet is ready. The showdown between mankind’s technological prowess and the powerful forces of the occult has begun! It's up to Flame and Grit to defeat the Weapon Keepers, and ultimately face off against Ravenous, the sinister leader of the invasion.

  The year is 2048, and the world is plagued with economic downturn, environmental disaster, and societal destabilization. In the United States, natural resource scarcity and severe climate change have led to massive urbanization, with millions of Americans forced to seek new lives among the sprawling steel and concrete of America’s cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  These swelling urban populations, coupled with intense civil unrest, have culminated in greatly increased crime rates, with many cities becoming dense hives of vice and lawlessness. City governments and law enforcement do their best to stem the rising tide of crime, but are oftentimes ineffectual due to severe corruption and the increasing sophistication of American criminals.

 <br>
 Welcome to Mars!
</strong>
<br>
<br>
<i>Rover Mechanic Simulator</i> is a game in which you are a mechanic working on one of the first Martian colonies. Your main tasks include the repair and maintenance of Mars rovers, so that the remaining crew can collect detailed information about the structure of the planet.
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Use various devices!
</strong>
<br>
<br>
There are many devices at your disposal that will allow you to dismantle and maintain even the smallest parts of the rover. Use different tools such as a 3D printer, recycling machine, overhead crane, soldering iron and many more.
<strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>
 <br>
 <br>
 Fix damaged PCBs

 <br>
 <br>
 Not all parts need to be replaced entirely. You can use special workbenches to repair damaged PCBs, clean and maintain parts that have worn out during rover's work. Thanks to this, you can save resources for much more difficult tasks.
 <strong class=&quot;hmb&quot;>

 <br>
 <br>
 The game offers you several development paths that you can choose. Are you a tinkerer who enjoys disassembling devices into small parts? Become a technician! But if you prefer to precisely analyze the damaged parts and find malfunctions faster, then become an analyst. If you want to master the recovery of resources, follow the economist’s path.

<br>
Long ago the world of magic was separated from the natural world by Elemental Gates. One day the seal on the gates was broken, flooding the natural world with magical fae creatures once thought to be myths. The worlds merging was imperfect and much of the land was torn apart. The devastation claimed the lives of most of the population of natural and fae creatures alike. Those that survived have forged new lives in the ruins of the old worlds, but growing tension between man and fae threaten to finish what began with the opening of the gates.
